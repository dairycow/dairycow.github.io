  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Financial Performance (6 months to 31 Dec 2024)**  \n- **Revenue**: $7.8M (+100% YoY)  \n- **Loss before tax**: $23.0M (+506% YoY)  \n- **Loss per share (basic/diluted)**: 2.3 cents (+472% YoY)  \n- **Cash balance**: $1.0M (up from $0.8M at 30 Jun 2024)  \n- **Net tangible assets**: Nil per share (unchanged).  \n\n#### **Operational Highlights**  \n- **Dolphin Tungsten Project**:  \n  - Production: 257kt ore mined; 79kt processed (avg. grade 0.75%, recovery 44%).  \n  - Concentrate shipped: 433t (avg. grade 58%).  \n  - Operational challenges: Plant breakdowns, workforce shortages.  \n- **Tungsten market**: APT price $300\u2013$325/mtu (Rotterdam CIF).  \n\n#### **Capital Structure & Debt Recapitalization**  \n- **Debt conversion (completed 30 Apr 2025)**:  \n  - $81.1M debt + interest converted to equity via 19.2B new shares.  \n  - $5.9M equity raised via 1.7B shares ($0.0035/share).  \n  - 7.2B warrants issued (exercise price $0.0035, expiry Oct 2025).  \n- **New loans**:  \n  - $17.8M facility from Senior Lending Group ($14.0M drawn by 31 Dec 2024).  \n  - $7.5M from Tasmanian Government (fully drawn May 2025, maturity Apr 2027).  \n- **Post-recapitalization proforma**: Net debt reduced to $33.2M (mostly due Apr 2027).  \n\n#### **Subsequent Events**  \n- **Options/warrants**:  \n  - 76M options issued to Executive Chairman (Kevin Pallas).  \n  - Multiple options expired/lapsed (e.g., 21.1M G6MAK @ $0.28).  \n- **R&D tax refund**: $2.1M received June 2025.  \n\n#### **Liquidity & Going Concern**  \n- **Material uncertainty**: Relies on operational turnaround (plant optimization, cost cuts) to avoid covenant breaches.  \n- **Cash forecast assumptions**:  \n  - Target processing rate: 24kt/month ore @ 0.7% grade, 60% recovery.  \n  - APT price: $347/mtu USD (AUD/USD 0.67).  \n\n### **Key Takeaways for Trading/Capital Markets**  \n1. **High financial risk**: Negative equity ($81.1M deficit), aggressive dilution (19.2B shares issued), and operational underperformance.  \n2. **Debt overhang addressed**: Recapitalization reduces near-term liquidity pressure but leaves significant leverage.  \n3. **Execution dependency**: Valuation hinges on operational stabilization and tungsten price strength.  \n\n**No dividends declared.**  \n\n---  \n*Summary excludes non-material governance, legal, and routine operational details.*",
