  "summary": "### Material Information Summary (ASX Announcement Review)  \n\n- **Operational Update**:  \n  - **Serowe-3.4A well** now online and dewatering.  \n  - **Serowe-3.1**: Acid-washing tripled well pressure, indicating strong reservoir response.  \n  - **New well Serowe-3.5B** added to replicate MAS-13\u2019s sustained flowrate (~120,000 scfd).  \n  - **Cost efficiency**: Serowe-3.5B estimated at ~A$200k (vs. A$370k budget for stimulated wells), leveraging in-house capabilities.  \n  - **Five-well dewatering strategy** implemented to optimize reservoir drainage.  \n\nNo capital raising, financial results, or material structural changes identified. Focus is on operational progress and cost efficiencies.",
