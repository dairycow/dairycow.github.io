  "summary": "Here\u2019s the concise extraction of material information from the ASX announcement:\n\n### **Exploration Discovery Announcement**  \n- **New high-grade discovery**: Copper-cobalt-silver mineralisation at **Aquila Prospect** (Mt Oxide Project, Queensland).  \n- **Drill highlights**:  \n  - **MOX233**:  \n    - 30m @ **2.45% Cu**, 0.02% Co, 6.2 g/t Ag (from 20m), including 10m @ **5.31% Cu**.  \n    - 98m @ 0.61% Cu, 0.06% Co, 2.0 g/t Ag (from 57m).  \n  - **MOX232**: 145m @ **0.75% Cu**, 0.12% Co, 2.9 g/t Ag (from 28m), including 5m @ **4.30% Cu**.  \n  - **MOX231**: 34m @ 0.71% Cu (from 146m), including 1m @ **4.68% Cu**.  \n- **Key takeaways**:  \n  - Shallow, high-grade mineralisation open at depth and along strike.  \n  - Potential for a **large-scale deposit** analogous to the nearby **Vero Resource** (15.03Mt @ 1.46% Cu).  \n  - Cobalt grades (up to 0.52% Co) add significant value.  \n- **Next steps**:  \n  - Expand geophysical surveys (~3km strike extension).  \n  - High-resolution drone magnetics and follow-up drilling planned.  \n- **Financial position**: Company is \"funded for development\" (no specific cash balance disclosed).  \n\n### **Material Impact**  \n- Confirms **new mineralised system** with potential to expand Mt Oxide\u2019s resource base.  \n- High-grade intercepts may positively impact **resource valuation** and future project economics.  \n\n*No capital raising, trading halt, or financial results disclosed.*",
