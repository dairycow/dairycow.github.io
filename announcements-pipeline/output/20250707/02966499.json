  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary \u2013 Anson Resources (ASX: ASN)**  \n\n- **Strategic Land Expansion**:  \n  - Added **100 placer claims** (+8.23km\u00b2, **10% increase**) at the Green River Lithium Project (Utah, USA).  \n  - **28% of new claims** fall within the Area of Influence (AOI) and will be included in future **JORC Resource upgrades**.  \n\n- **Key Geological Highlights**:  \n  - Two historical oil wells (**Grand Fault Unit 14-24** and **Green River Unit 1**) on new claims recorded **near-surface brine flows**, indicating high porosity/permeability.  \n  - Grand Fault well is **adjacent to a continuously flowing geyser**, reinforcing reservoir potential.  \n  - **No lithium assays** from historic wells, but proximity to confirmed lithium-rich brine wells (e.g., Boysdaba #1) supports exploration upside.  \n\n- **Resource Potential**:  \n  - Thick Mississippian Unit (**672 feet**) suggests broad brine reservoir.  \n  - Claims abut a recently granted **State OBA lease**, creating a contiguous 88.61km\u00b2 area.  \n\n**No material financial/timetable data identified.**  \n\n*Brevity Note: Omitted operational/technical details (e.g., JORC tables) as they do not materially alter immediate valuation or liquidity.*",
