  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n- **Drilling Commencement**: Maiden diamond drilling program initiated at La Florida copper prospect (Fortuna Project, Chile).  \n- **Program Scope**:  \n  - 4-hole, ~1,400m drill program targeting high-priority copper zones (footprints up to 1,700m x 500m).  \n  - Targets show alteration/geochemical zonation indicative of copper mineralization.  \n- **Historic Results**:  \n  - Surface samples previously returned up to **3.96% Cu** and **2.61g/t Au**.  \n- **Funding**: Program fully funded by **A$3M equity raise** completed May 2025.  \n- **Pending Data**: Assays from trenching program still outstanding.  \n- **Context**:  \n  - La Florida exhibits similarities to Lana Corina discovery (prior drill intercept: **454m at 0.93% CuEq**).  \n\n**No material capital markets or trading actions announced** (e.g., raise, halt, liquidity change). Focus is exploratory progress.",
