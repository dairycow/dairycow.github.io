  "summary": "- **Drilling Commencement**: Maiden RC drilling program at Greenewood gold discovery (127 planned holes, ~10,000m total, ~79m avg. depth).  \n- **JV Structure**: Greenewood is part of the Golden Moon JV (Marmota holds 90% via Half Moon).  \n- **Gold Price Context**: Current gold price (~A$5000/oz) is ~3x higher than during last drilling (2018: ~A$1600/oz).  \n- **Historical Drilling**: Only 8,245m of prior drilling at Greenewood; new program more than doubles RC holes.  \n- **Location**: Greenewood is ~35km NW of Marmota\u2019s Aurora Tank deposit and ~30km NE of Challenger Gold mine.  \n\n*Note*: Operational update with no direct capital markets impact (e.g., no raising, financials, or timetable). Focus on exploration progress and gold price leverage.",
