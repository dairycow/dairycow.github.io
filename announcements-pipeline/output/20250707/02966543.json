  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n- **Key Exploration Results**:  \n  - Completion of a **59.5-line km MLEM survey** at the Ilgarari Copper Project, identifying **multiple high-priority EM targets**, including a modelled plate down-dip from historic high-grade zones.  \n  - **Drilling imminent**: Fully permitted (heritage clearance secured), with drilling to commence in coming weeks.  \n  - **Historic high-grade intercepts**: Highlighted in tables (e.g., 24m @ 4.23% Cu, 6m @ 7.33% Cu incl. 2m @ 20.65% Cu).  \n\n- **Project Context**:  \n  - Located **120km north of Sandfire\u2019s DeGrussa Copper-Gold Mine** (high-grade benchmark).  \n  - **Earn-in agreement**: Lord Resources holds rights to sulphide mineralisation **below 120m depth** (80% interest upon spending AUD 1.5M within 4 years).  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Finalize EM data modelling.  \n  - Commence maiden drilling program to test EM targets.  \n\n- **Cautionary Notes**:  \n  - Historic drill results **above 120m RL are unverified** (no QA/QC) and excluded from JORC reporting. These will not be used for future resource estimates.  \n\n**Rationale**: Focused on actionable exploration catalysts (drilling timeline, high-grade potential) and jurisdictional advantages (WA copper exposure). Excluded non-material operational/historical details.",
