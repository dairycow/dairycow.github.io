  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (American West Metals Limited - High-Grade Copper Hits at Storm Copper Project):  \n\n#### **Material Information for Trading/Capital Markets Decisions:**  \n- **Drilling Results:**  \n  - **Diamond Drilling:**  \n    - Hole ST25-04 intersected **~57m of visual sediment-hosted copper sulphides**, extending mineralisation potential at Cirrus.  \n    - 9 diamond holes completed (total 2,295m), assays pending in 4-6 weeks.  \n  - **RC Drilling (Assays Confirmed):**  \n    - **Near-surface high-grade copper intercepts:**  \n      - **12.2m @ 1.9% Cu, 77g/t Ag** (including 4.6m @ 3.2% Cu, 129g/t Ag) at Corona.  \n      - **7.6m @ 1.7% Cu** at Corona.  \n      - **7.6m @ 1.1% Cu** at The Gap (assays pending below 128m).  \n\n- **Implications:**  \n  - Results support **resource upgrade potential** for existing deposits (Cyclone, Chinook, Corona, Cirrus).  \n  - Expansion potential at **The Gap prospect**, with maiden resource potential.  \n  - Confirms **large-scale copper system** with deeper mineralisation untested.  \n\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Assays for deeper diamond drilling (including ST25-04) expected in **6-8 weeks**.  \n  - Ongoing drilling to extend known zones (Thunder, Lightning Ridge, The Gap).  \n\n#### **Key Omissions:**  \n- No capital raising, financials, or operational cash balance disclosed.  \n- No new JORC resource estimates or material changes to project economics.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Positive exploration update with high-grade intercepts, reinforcing growth potential at Storm. Near-term catalyst: assay results from deeper drilling.",
