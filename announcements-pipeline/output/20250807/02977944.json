  "summary": "### Material Information Summary (ECS Botanics FY25 Investor Presentation):  \n**Market & Strategy Shifts:**  \n- **B2B pressure:** Australian medicinal cannabis market shifted in late FY24, with B2B customers sourcing directly from international suppliers (e.g., largest oil customer switched to Canadian imports). Flower prices dropped **20% YoY**.  \n- **Strategic pivot:** Focus on **B2C growth** (higher margins), **exports** (stronger margins despite lower per-gram revenue), and **new products** (capsules, branded flower like OzSun).  \n\n**Financial & Operational Highlights:**  \n- **Production:** Record **10.6T untrimmed dried flower in FY25** (vs. 6.6T FY24). Flower accounts for **~70% of sales**.  \n- **Sales trends:**  \n  - B2C sales grew to **$2.6M in Q4 FY25** (from $0.1M launch).  \n  - EU/UK exports reached **$5.0M in Q4 FY25** (vs. $4.4M Q4 FY24).  \n- **Costs:**  \n  - **$1.48M increase in salaries** (mainly for B2C sales/MSLs, quality, and executive roles).  \n  - Labor-intensive flower production; efficiencies improving (wages rose 21% vs. flower sales up 34%).  \n\n**Liquidity & Cash Flow:**  \n- **Inventory buildup:** B2C/consignment model required upfront stock, but now stabilized to replacement levels.  \n- **Capital works:** In-house construction (completed by Oct-26) funded via operating cash.  \n\n**Growth Catalysts:**  \n- **New markets:** Pending regulatory approval for **GMP flower exports to Germany**; NZ contract secured.  \n- **Brands:** Terphogz launch in Australia; VESIsorb capsules performing well.  \n\n**No material capital raising or trading halt information identified.**  \n\n*Note: Omitted non-material operational details, disclaimers, and forward-looking statements.*",
