  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement:  \n\n- **Notice of Expiry for Listed Options (RC1O):**  \n  - **Total Options:** 110,656,800 exercisable at $0.032 each.  \n  - **Expiry Date:** 8th September 2025 (unpaid options expire with no value).  \n  - **No Expiry Notices Sent:** Options are substantially out of the money (current share price: $0.008 vs. exercise price: $0.032).  \n  - **Quotation Ceases:** On or around 3rd September 2025.  \n  - **Potential Equity Impact:** Full exercise would issue 110,656,800 new shares (dilutive if exercised, but unlikely due to deep out-of-money status).  \n\n**Key Takeaway:** No immediate trading impact; options are non-material due to low probability of exercise.  \n\n*No further material information identified.*",
