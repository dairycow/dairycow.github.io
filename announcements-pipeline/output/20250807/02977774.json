  "summary": "### Summary of Material Information:  \n- **Drilling Program**: 35,300m grade control and infill drilling at Gold Duke Project (WA).  \n- **Timing**: Program to commence mid-August, completed within 8 weeks. Assay updates every 7-8 days.  \n- **Key Benefits**:  \n  - Eliminates need for grade control drilling during production.  \n  - Enhances mine scheduling flexibility.  \n  - Supports rapid path-to-production (mining operations targeted late Q4 2025).  \n- **Contractor**: VM Drilling (local WA Goldfields-based, using fuel-efficient Epiroc rigs).  \n- **Upcoming Catalyst**: Scoping Study update expected in coming weeks to improve project economics.  \n\n**No material capital markets or trading-specific data (e.g., raising, halt, or financials) identified.**",
