  "summary": "Here\u2019s the material information extracted from the **Change of Director\u2019s Interest Notice** for Strategic Energy Resources Limited:  \n\n### **Key Changes in Director Holdings (31 July 2025)**  \n**Anthony McIntosh:**  \n- **5,900,000 new ordinary shares** issued via exercise of unlisted options.  \n- **5,900,000 options lapsed** (1.5M expiring 30 Nov 2025; 2M expiring 23 Nov 2026; 2.4M expiring 2 Dec 2027).  \n- **Post-change holdings:** 22,190,343 ordinary shares.  \n\n**David DeTata:**  \n- **12,000,000 new ordinary shares** issued via exercise of unlisted options.  \n- **18,000,000 options lapsed** (6M expiring 23 Nov 2026; 12M expiring 2 Dec 2027).  \n- **Post-change holdings:** 15,900,000 (direct) + 12,000,000 (indirect) ordinary shares.  \n\n**Stuart Rechner:**  \n- **10,000,000 new ordinary shares** issued via exercise of unlisted options.  \n- **14,000,000 options lapsed** (6M expiring 23 Nov 2026; 8M expiring 2 Dec 2027).  \n- **Post-change holdings:** 13,000,000 (direct) + 13,850,000 (indirect) ordinary shares.  \n\n**General Notes:**  \n- All transactions involved **nil consideration** (option exercises).  \n- No closed-period trading concerns.  \n\n**Impact:** Material increase in issued shares (~27.9M new shares) and reduction in options (~37.9M lapsed). No immediate liquidity/dilution risk noted, but monitor future filings for capital structure changes.  \n\n**Summary:** Significant director option exercises, but no market-sensitive price action expected from disclosure alone.  \n**Final Note:** If deeper analysis is required for capital structure impact (e.g., total shares outstanding post-transaction), cross-check with company\u2019s most recent share registry or subsequent announcements.  \n\n---  \n**Formatting rationale:** Kept bullets strictly related to *quantifiable* changes in director holdings (material to ownership structure) and omitted boilerplate/legal text. Added \"Impact\" only where actionable insight exists.",
