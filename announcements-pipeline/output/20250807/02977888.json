  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n**Exploration/Project Update Announcement:**  \n- **Flow rate confirmation:** Bosydaba#1 exploration well meets minimum flow rate of **6,000 barrels/day (250bbl/hr)**, sufficient for planned demonstration plant.  \n- **Cost/time savings:** No additional drilling or tubing modifications required, reducing capex and accelerating timeline.  \n- **Pump potential:** Installing a pump at 10,000\u2019 depth could further increase flow rates (beyond 6,000bbl/day).  \n- **Validation:** Flow rate calculation based on swabbing data (including brine replenishment, depth, and hydrostatic pressure) verified by third-party oil/gas engineers.  \n\n**No material information identified for trading/capital decisions** (e.g., capital raising, liquidity events, or financial results).  \n\n*Note: JORC details and operational methodologies excluded as non-material for immediate trading/capital decisions.*",
