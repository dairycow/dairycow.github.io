  "summary": "Understood. Please provide the ASX announcement PDF, and I will extract **only material information** relevant for trading or capital markets decisions in the strict format you've outlined.  \n\nIf the document isn't available now, here's how I'll structure the response based on common announcement types:  \n\n1. **Trading Halt/Voluntary Suspension Request**  \n   - *Reason*: (e.g., \"Pending material acquisition announcement\" or \"Capital raising proposal\").  \n\n2. **Capital Raising**  \n   - *Type*: Placement / Entitlement Offer / SPP / Rights Issue.  \n   - *Amount raised*: AUD $X (or target range).  \n   - *Use of proceeds*: (e.g., \"Debt reduction, project funding\").  \n   - *Key dates*: Ex-date [DD/MM], Record date [DD/MM], Close date [DD/MM].  \n   - *Discount*: (if applicable, e.g., \"10% to VWAP\").  \n\n3. **Quarterly (4C) or Half-Yearly (4D) Report**  \n   - *Cash balance*: AUD $X.  \n   - *Cash burn*: AUD $X (if 4C).  \n   - *Key operational milestones*: (e.g., \"Production reached Y, new contract signed with Z\").  \n\n4. **Material Contracts/Projects**  \n   - *Key terms*: (e.g., \"10-year offtake agreement at $Y/unit\").  \n\n5. **M&A/Divestment**  \n   - *Deal value*: AUD $X.  \n   - *Conditions*: (e.g., \"Subject to shareholder approval\").  \n\n6. **Governance/Directors**  \n   - *Only if material*: (e.g., \"CEO resigns, successor named\").  \n\n**For all others**: \"No material information identified\" or summarise key impacts in 1\u20132 bullets.  \n\nYou can share the document, or specify the announcement type if known (e.g., \"Assume it\u2019s a capital raising notice\"). I\u2019ll adhere strictly to your format.  \n\n*Note*: I\u2019ll verify that extracted data matches ASX formatting conventions (e.g., AUD millions, standard date formats). Let me know if you'd like additional focus areas (e.g., debt covenants in a recapitalisation).",
