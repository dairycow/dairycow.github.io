  "summary": "Here is the concise summary of material information from the ASX announcement:\n\n### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE):** 953koz gold @ 2.4g/t Au (cut-off: 1g/t).  \n- **Exploration Upside:** Only 21,500m of drilling completed so far (90% focused on Main Zone). Newly identified Doyles fold (500m west of Main Zone) has potential to expand MRE.  \n- **Recent Drill Results:**  \n  - SC108/SC109 intersected arsenopyrite veining and gold mineralization 200m below prior drilling.  \n  - SC109 returned **4m @ 2.3g/t Au**, suggesting increasing mineralization at depth.  \n- **Near-Term Catalysts:**  \n  - Mining permit decision expected by **end of 2025**.  \n  - Infill drilling (to upgrade Inferred to Indicated MRE) targeted for completion by **Q2 2026**.  \n  - Updated MRE and Scoping Study to be released in **Q3 2026**.  \n- **Strategic Outlook:** Potential to access new mineralization (Doyles, Western Outcrops, Anvil) via centralized underground development, enhancing project economics.  \n\n**No capital raising or financial data disclosed.**  \n**No material operational updates beyond exploration progress.**  \n\n*Summary focuses on valuation-impacting exploration results and milestones.*",
