  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary: Drilling Update (Perpetual Resources Ltd, ASX: PEC)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights Relevant for Trading/Capital Markets:**  \n- **200m continuous LCT pegmatite intersected** at Target 1 (Igrejinha Project, Brazil), open in all directions, with potential for **caesium (pollucite) and lithium (spodumene)** mineralisation.  \n- **Potential high-value caesium discovery**: Visual observations and pXRF readings suggest pollucite presence (globally rare, strategic mineral). **Assays pending** (first results expected mid-July).  \n- **Historic high-grade samples**:  \n  - Rock chip samples: Up to **7.6% Li\u2082O** and **41.5% Cs\u2082O** (pXRF spot readings; not lab-confirmed).  \n  - 1m channel sample: **3.26% Li\u2082O**.  \n- **New regional target identified**: Untested pegmatite with **300m strike length** in southeast license area.  \n- **Drilling progress**: 750m completed (of 1,500m program); completion expected late July.  \n\n#### **Cautionary Notes:**  \n- pXRF and visual mineral estimates are **non-definitive**; assays required for validation.  \n- Pollucite (caesium) potential could position PEC as a **rare global explorer** in this commodity, pending lab results.  \n\n**Next Catalyst:** Initial assay results (mid-July).  \n\n---  \n**Summary tailored for brevity and material impact.** No capital raising, financials, or valuation metrics disclosed in this announcement.",
