  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Drilling Results Update (Black Mountain Lithium Project)**  \n- **Phase 2 Drilling Completed**:  \n  - 20 shallow reverse circulation (RC) holes drilled (783.6m total).  \n  - **Mineralization Intersected**:  \n    - 5 holes returned grades **>0.5% Li\u2082O** (best intercepts: **0.58\u20130.99% Li\u2082O** over **0.6\u20131.8m**).  \n    - Shallow mineralization (surface to ~42m depth); lower grades than expected.  \n  - **Key Limitation**: Weather delays restricted drilling in high-potential **Southern Crest** area (untested; spodumene outcrops previously sampled at **2.04\u20136.68% Li\u2082O**).  \n\n- **Geological Findings**:  \n  - Pegmatite system more complex than anticipated, with **shallow southwest dip** (contrary to initial assumptions).  \n  - Untested **150m gap** between Northern Crest and Northwest Flank zones.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Priority drilling planned for **Southern Crest**.  \n  - Follow-up targeting in Northern Crest/Northwest Flank based on revised pegmatite orientation.  \n\n#### **Base Metals Note**  \n- Low-grade zinc intersected (**0.57% Zn over 24.8m** in BMRC24-03). No further focus planned.  \n\n**No material capital, financial, or trading-impacting details (e.g., raising, liquidity events) disclosed.**  \n\n---  \n*Summary tailored for trading/capital markets; excludes operational details without material valuation impact.*",
