  "summary": "- **Business Closure**: Bega Group (ASX:BGA) to wind down Peanut Company of Australia (PCA) operations over 18 months, including facilities in Kingaroy and Tolga (Queensland).  \n- **Financial Impact**: PCA incurred annual operating losses of $5-10M; shutdown to eliminate these losses. Expected one-off cash costs (redundancies, etc.) of $5-10M.  \n- **Reason**: Unsustainable business model due to industry headwinds (import competition, low peanut production, high costs). No viable buyer found.  \n- **Workforce Impact**: ~150 affected employees; redundancies and support offered.  \n- **Remaining Operations**: Bega retains other Queensland facilities (Crestmead, Malanda).  \n\nNo material financial/trading dates or capital structure changes identified.",
