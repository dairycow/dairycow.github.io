  "summary": "- **Business Closure**: Bega Group (BGA) to wind down Peanut Company of Australia (PCA) operations over 18 months, closing Kingaroy and Tolga facilities.  \n- **Financial Impact**: PCA incurred annual losses of $5-10M; shutdown to eliminate ongoing losses with one-off costs of $5-10M (mostly redundancies).  \n- **Reason for Closure**: Unsustainable business model due to industry headwinds (import competition, high costs, declining production).  \n- **No Material Capital/Liquidity Impact**: Bega retains other Queensland facilities; shutdown costs are manageable relative to group operations.  \n\n*No material trading or capital markets action required.*",
