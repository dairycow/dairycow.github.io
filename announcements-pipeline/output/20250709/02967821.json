  "summary": "Here\u2019s the concise extraction of material information from the ASX announcement:\n\n**Exploration Update Highlights:**  \n- **Target Confirmation:** Field mapping identifies upper levels of a **copper porphyry system** at surface, supporting hypothesis of deeper mineralisation.  \n- **Key Findings:**  \n  - Argillic alteration and silicification observed, indicative of porphyry system.  \n  - Historic drillhole re-logging (e.g., 22LHRC024) shows hydrothermal alteration consistent with porphyry.  \n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Geophysical reprocessing (MAG, IP, MT) to refine drill targets (results expected in coming weeks).  \n  - **Phase I drilling** scheduled to commence **Q4 2025**.  \n\n**No material capital markets or trading-impacting data identified** (e.g., no capital raising, M&A, or financial results). Focus is exploratory progress with no immediate liquidity/capital structure implications.",
