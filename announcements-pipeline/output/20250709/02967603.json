  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights (Resource Upgrade Announcement)**  \n- **Resource Upgrade**:  \n  - Total **151,000 oz Au** and **902,000 oz Ag** at **1.40 g/t Au** and **8.4 g/t Ag**, across **3.3Mt**.  \n    - **Indicated**: 2.2Mt @ **1.40 g/t Au**, **9.7 g/t Ag** (67% of total).  \n    - **Inferred**: 1.1Mt @ **1.54 g/t Au**, **6.6 g/t Ag**.  \n  - **16% increase in gold resource** vs. prior estimate.  \n\n- **Exploration Upside**: Mineralization remains **open along strike and at depth**, with drilling planned to expand resources.  \n\n- **Strategic Impact**:  \n  - Bolsters QMines\u2019 **hub-and-spoke production model** in Central Queensland.  \n  - Combined JORC resources now **~20Mt** across three 100%-owned projects.  \n\n#### **Operational Context**  \n- **Mt. Mackenzie** will feed into the **Mt. Chalmers processing plant** (140km away), improving project economics.  \n\n#### **Forward-Looking Notes**  \n- No immediate capital-raising or trading halt declared. Focus on resource growth and integration into mine planning.  \n\n**Conclusion**: Material for valuation due to **increased resource scale, higher confidence (Indicated category dominance), and strategic synergies** with existing assets.  \n\n---  \n*Omitted: Geological details, drilling methods, JORC compliance, and non-material operational updates.*",
