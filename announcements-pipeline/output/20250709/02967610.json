  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Drilling Program Update**:  \n  - Extension of drilling program at **Amadee Prospect**, part of the **Bousquet Gold Project** (Quebec, Canada).  \n  - Amadee exhibits similar geology to high-grade **Paquin Prospect**, including smoky quartz veins with historical intercepts of **1.52m @ 6.8g/t Au**.  \n  - Current drilling aims to test potential >1km mineralized strike linking Amadee and Paquin.  \n\n- **Upcoming Catalysts**:  \n  - **First assay results** expected **mid-July 2025** from the ongoing drill program.  \n\n- **Historical Highlights**:  \n  - Amadee\u2019s mineralization spans >200m strike length, with surface samples up to **8.0g/t Au (channel sampling)**.  \n  - Paquin Trend (hosting both prospects) has recorded visible gold in recent drilling (ASX: 24 June 2025).  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Three additional drillholes planned at Amadee to test western extension of mineralization.  \n\n*No material capital, operational, or financial updates disclosed; focus remains on exploration progress.*",
