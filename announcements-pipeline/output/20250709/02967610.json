  "summary": "### **Key Material Information Summary**  \n\n- **Drilling Program Extension**: Extension of drilling at the **Amadee Prospect**, part of the **Bousquet Project** (Quebec, Canada), due to similarities with the high-grade **Paquin Prospect**.  \n- **Historical Mineralisation**: Amadee drilling (1940) intersected **1.52m @ 6.8g/t Au**, with surface samples up to **8.0g/t Au**. Current drilling confirms smoky quartz veining at depth.  \n- **Exploration Upside**: Potential for **>1km mineralised structure** linking Paquin and Amadee, with mineralization open along strike (>200m) and at depth.  \n- **Near-term Catalyst**: **First assay results expected mid-July 2025**; further drilling planned to test western extension.  \n\nNo capital raising, financials, or material corporate changes announced. Focus remains on exploration results and near-term catalysts.  \n\n---  \n*Summary tailored for trading/capital markets relevance, excluding operational and geological detail not impacting immediate valuation or liquidity.*",
