  "summary": "Here\u2019s the concise extraction of material information for trading/capital markets decisions from the ASX announcement:\n\n### **Key Highlights (Metallurgical Testwork & PFS Update)**  \n- **Heap Leach Viability Confirmed**:  \n  - Gold recoveries up to **85%** (average **75%**) in low-grade material (as low as **0.15 g/t Au**).  \n  - Outperforms global heap leach averages (typically **55\u201379%**).  \n  - **\u00bd-inch crush size** achieves **75% recovery**, reducing processing costs.  \n\n- **Economic Impact**:  \n  - **74.3 Mt** of previously unevaluated low-grade material (**2.9 Moz AuEq**) now potentially viable.  \n  - Potential to significantly expand project scale vs. Scoping Study\u2019s **7.2 Mt** plan.  \n\n- **PFS Timeline**:  \n  - Final metallurgical testwork (flotation, comminution, column leach) **on track for completion by early Q4 2025**.  \n  - **PFS expected to incorporate heap leach circuit**, transforming project economics.  \n\n### **Strategic Implications**  \n- **Open-Pit Potential**: Heap leaching enables larger-scale, lower-cost mining vs. underground scenario.  \n- **Resource Upgrade**: Low-grade \"waste\" material may now contribute to revenue.  \n\n### **Next Steps**  \n- **Panel 4 testing**: Larger-diameter (6\") column leach trials to validate commercial-scale viability.  \n\n**No material capital raising, trading halt, or financial data disclosed.** The update is operational but underscores **significant upside to project economics**.  \n\n---  \n*Summary tailored for ECM/trading focus; excludes JORC/technical minutiae.*",
