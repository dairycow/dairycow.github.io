  "summary": "### Summary of Material Information:  \n\n- **Legislative Impact on Longroad Energy (Infratil subsidiary):**  \n  - **Tax Credit Eligibility:**  \n    - Extended safe-harbor window (12 months vs. 60 days) and PIS deadlines (4\u20135 years vs. ~2.5 years).  \n    - Transferability of tax credits preserved (unlike original House proposal).  \n  - **FEOC Rules:**  \n    - Applies only to projects starting construction after **31 December 2025**.  \n    - No excise tax; material assistance thresholds set (40% for solar, 55% for BESS).  \n  - **Battery Storage:** Phase-down delayed to **2034**, but FEOC rules pose challenges for Chinese-reliant projects.  \n\n- **Strategic Positioning:**  \n  - **Longroad has 2.6GW safe-harbored** (up from 1.8GW in May).  \n  - Targets **1.5GW/year new starts (2025\u20132027)**, potential to extend safe-harbor to **2029/2030**.  \n  - **First Solar partnership** mitigates FEOC risks for solar projects.  \n\n- **Executive Order Risk:**  \n  - Potential narrower interpretation of safe-harbor rules (Treasury guidance due in **45 days**).  \n\n- **Market Tailwinds:**  \n  - Strong demand from data centers, electrification, and domestic manufacturing supports long-term growth.  \n\n*No trading or capital actions announced.*",
