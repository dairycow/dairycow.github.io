  "summary": "- **Quarterly Revenue & Production (Q2 2025):**  \n  - Unaudited oil sales revenue: **~US$1.8m (~A$2.8m)** from ~47,000 barrels (avg. **US$38/bbl**).  \n  - Cash receipts: **~A$3.01m** (timing variance due to prepayments).  \n  - Production: **47,000 barrels** (Akkar North: 9,600bbl; Akkar East: 26,100bbl; West Zhetybai: 11,300bbl).  \n\n- **Sales Channels:**  \n  - **Domestic sales (Pavlodar refinery):** ~17,000bbl at **US$41/bbl** (A$1.09m).  \n  - **Mini refinery sales:** ~30,000bbl at **US$37/bbl** (A$1.71m).  \n  - No export sales (awaiting favorable pricing).  \n\n- **Capital & Debt:**  \n  - **Cash reserves (30 June 2025):** **~A$3.23m**.  \n  - **Debt outstanding:** **US$15.17m** (interest-free until Dec 2026), reducing to **US$14.67m** after July 2025 repayment.  \n  - Shares on issue: **1,280,718,854** (post-director fee issuance).  \n\nLearning Approach:  \n1. **Prioritized Materiality:** Excluded routine operational details (e.g., license maintenance, director appointments) unless directly impacting financials.  \n2. **Structured for Traders:** Grouped related data (e.g., revenue + production, debt + cash) to highlight liquidity/valuation drivers.  \n3. **Conciseness:** Used symbols (e.g., **A$**) for quick parsing and omitted non-essential context (e.g., director names, boilerplate).  \n\nFeedback Request:  \nWould you prefer deeper segmentation (e.g., separating liquidity metrics from operations) or stricter adherence to specific announcement types?",
