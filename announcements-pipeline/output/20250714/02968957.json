  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement:  \n\n- **Key Issue**: Trigg Minerals (TMG) retracts previously reported **Foreign Estimate** (12.7Mt @ 0.79% Sb) and **Revised Foreign Estimate** (14Mt @ 0.75% Sb) for the Antimony Canyon Project due to non-compliance with ASX Guidance Note 31 (source documents were summaries, not originals).  \n- **Replacement Disclosure**: Company now reports an **Exploration Target** (JORC Code 2012) for the project, pending further validation.  \n- **Compliance**: TMG confirms adherence to ASX Listing Rules but acknowledges prior disclosure inaccuracies.  \n\n**No capital raising, operational, or financial data disclosed.**  \n\n*Material impact*: Retraction may affect market confidence in project resource claims; replaced with less certain Exploration Target.",
