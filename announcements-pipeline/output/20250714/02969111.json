  "summary": "### Summary of CitiFirst Instalment MINIs Announcement  \n**Document Type**: Product terms update for leveraged equity instruments (Instalment MINIs).  \n\n#### Key Material Points:  \n- **Current Interest Rate**: 8.30% p.a., effective from **15-Jul-25**.  \n\u8a98\u81f4  \n- **Product Structure**:  \n  - Leveraged instruments with partial payment (first instalment) and a final loan amount due at expiry.  \n  - **Stop Loss Trigger Levels**: Listed for each MINI, indicating automatic exit if underlying share price falls to this level.  \n  - **Gearing**: Ranges from ~10% to ~80%, affecting exposure (e.g., higher gearing = higher risk/return).  \n    - Example: **A2MJOB** (A2 Milk) has 47.11% gearing, stop loss at $4.07 (43.63% below current price $7.22).  \n  - **Dividend Treatment**: Most MINIs pay dividends to investors (e.g., \"Pay to investor\").  \n\n- **Expiry Dates**: Vary by instrument (e.g., **A2MJOB** expiry: 26-May-2026).  \n\n#### Trading Implications:  \n- **Risk Metrics**: % from stop loss shows cushion before automatic unwinding (e.g., **AGLJOA** has 28.11% buffer).  \n- **Liquidity/Valuation Impact**: High-geared MINIs (e.g., **BENJOC** at 63.61%) are more sensitive to underlying price swings.  \n\n**No material corporate actions or capital structure changes identified**.  \n\n*Note: Boilerplate/disclaimer text excluded as non-material.*",
