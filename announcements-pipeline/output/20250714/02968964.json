  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Operational Highlights**  \n- **Record IP60 flow rate**: SS-2H ST1 well achieved **6.8 MMcf/d** (Beetaloo Basin record), with a normalized rate of **12.4 MMcf/d** over 10,000 ft, comparable to Marcellus Shale averages.  \n- **Low decline**: Exit rate stable at **6.4 MMcf/d**, outperforming SS-1H\u2019s decline profile.  \n- **2025 Drilling Program**: Commenced with SS-4H well (first of **three wells**, targeting 30,000 ft combined lateral).  \n- **Gas Sales Commitment**: Program supports delivery of **40 MMcf/d** to NT Government under contract, addressing local energy demand.  \n\n#### **Key Implications**  \n- Reinforces commercial viability of Beetaloo Basin gas, with potential premium pricing vs. Henry Hub.  \n- Progress toward near-term revenue (2026 target) via NTG contract fulfillment.  \n\n*Omitted: Background details, forward-looking disclaimers, non-material operational specifics.*",
