  "summary": "Here\u2019s the material information extracted from the ASX announcement, formatted as concise bullet points tailored for trading/capital markets decisions:\n\n### **Exploration Results Announcement (Material Points)**  \n- **High-grade drill intercepts** with significant gold assays enhance previously reported antimony (Sb) and silver (Ag) results at Montezuma Project (Tasmania):  \n  - **MZS05**: 1.6m @ **5.14% SbEq** (1,825 g/t AgEq) + **1.31 g/t Au**  \n  - **MZS11**: 1.5m @ **9.16% SbEq** (3,254 g/t AgEq) + **1.54 g/t Au**  \n  - **MZS12**: 1.5m @ **1.69% SbEq** (599 g/t AuEq) + **3.26 g/t Au** (highest Au grade).  \n  - **MZS13**: 6.2m @ **3.19% SbEq** (1,133 g/t AgEq) + **1.72 g/t Au**.  \n\n- **Program Progress**:  \n  - First 9 holes assayed from **50\u201360-hole program** (8,000\u201310,000m); drilling ongoing.  \n  - Mineralization remains **open along strike and at depth**.  \n  - Additional assays pending.  \n\n- **Metallurgy**:  \n  - Gold not included in prior equivalents (no recovery data); ALS commissioned for new flotation tests (includes Au).  \n\n- **Commodity Context**:  \n  - **Antimony prices at record highs** (tripled in Western markets over 12 months).  \n  - Classified as **critical mineral** by Australian/Tasmanian governments; China banned exports to US (tight supply).  \n\n- **Key Metric**:  \n  - **No material changes** to prior disclosures; all technical assumptions remain valid.  \n\n### **Omitted**:  \n- Routine operational details, director commentary, JORC tables (unless material to valuation/trading).  \n\n**Summary**: High-grade Au-Sb-Ag results improve project economics, with drilling confirming open extensions. Antimony\u2019s critical status and price surge amplify strategic value.",
