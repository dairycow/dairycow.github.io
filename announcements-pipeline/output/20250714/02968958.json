  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n- **Retraction of Foreign Estimates**: TMG retracts previously reported foreign estimates (12.7Mt @ 0.79% Sb, 14Mt @ 0.75% Sb) due to non-compliance with ASX Listing Rule 5.12 and Guidance Note 31 (lack of original source documents/volumetric basis).  \n- **Exploration Target**: Company shifts focus to an **Exploration Target** (per JORC Code 2012) for Antimony Canyon Project, pending further verification.  \n- **Existing JORC Resource**: Wild Cattle Creek (NSW) retains **1.52Mt @ 1.97% Sb** (29,900t contained Sb) as per 19 Dec 2024 announcement.  \n\n**Impact**: Removal of previously cited estimates may affect short-term investor confidence, but exploration targets and existing resources remain key for valuation.  \n\n*No material trading/capital-raising details identified.*",
