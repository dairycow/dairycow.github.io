  "summary": "- **Retraction of Foreign Estimates**: TMG formally retracts previously reported foreign estimates (12.7Mt @ 0.79% Sb and 14Mt @ 0.75% Sb) due to lack of original source documentation and non-compliance with ASX Listing Rule 5.12/JORC.  \n- **Exploration Target**: Company shifts focus to an Exploration Target (JORC 2012) for Antimony Canyon Project, Utah, with plans to advance toward a Mineral Resource Estimate.  \n- **Material Impact**: Removal of prior estimates may affect investor perception of resource confidence; exploration progress now key to future valuation.  \n\n*No material financial/trading data or capital structure changes identified.*",
