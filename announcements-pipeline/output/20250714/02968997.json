  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n**ASX Aware Letter Exchange \u2013 G8 Education (GEM):**  \n- **Key Issue:** ASX queried GEM's delayed disclosure of a former employee being charged with child-related offences (publicly reported 1 July 2025).  \n- **GEM\u2019s Defense:**  \n  - Argued the information was **not material** as:  \n    - Charges related to **1 out of 399 centres**; no material financial/operational impact anticipated.  \n    - Information was **publicly available** (via police/media) before ASX announcement (2 July 2025).  \n    - Sector already under negative sentiment (since March 2025) with no prior material price impact.  \n  - **Share Price Decline:** ~20% drop (1\u201311 July 2025) attributed to broader sector sentiment/regulatory uncertainty, not exclusively this event.  \n- **ASX Pushback:** Rejected \"publicly available\" defense, citing Listing Rule 3.1 requires disclosure even if market-sensitive info is leaked.  \n- **Outcome:** GEM maintains compliance with Listing Rules; no further action disclosed.  \n\n**No trading halt, capital raising, or financial data identified.**",
