  "summary": "Here\u2019s a concise summary of the material information from the ASX announcement by **King River Resources Ltd (ASX: KRR)**:\n\n### **Exploration Update Highlights**  \n- **Kurundi RC Drilling (April 2025):**  \n  - New mineralized structure intersected **300m NE of Kurundi Main**, with highlight:  \n    - **4m @ 1.43g/t Au (inc. 2m @ 2.79g/t Au)** in hole TTRC188.  \n  - **Kurundi Main Zone**: Confirmed extensions but no significant high grades in deeper drilling.  \n  - Structural complexity noted in southern high-grade zone, suggesting displaced mineralization.  \n\n- **Kuiper IOCG Targets (Soil Sampling):**  \n  - Promising geochemical anomalies (Au, Cu, Bi, As) over coincident gravity/magnetic targets.  \n  - **Bismuth anomaly** at Kuiper West aligns with gravity target, supporting IOCG potential.  \n  - **Drilling planned to commence July 2025**.  \n\n- **Upcoming Exploration**:  \n  - Next phase of drilling at **Kuiper** and further target generation across Tennant Creek tenements.  \n  - Ionic leach soil sampling to refine priority targets (e.g., Rover East, Pioneer, Barkly).  \n\n### **Key Implications**  \n- **Trading Catalyst**: Positive drill results (new structure at Kurundi) and imminent drilling at Kuiper may impact sentiment.  \n- **Exploration Upside**: Kuiper\u2019s IOCG potential and Kurundi\u2019s structural extensions warrant monitoring for future resource growth.  \n\n### **Excluded**:  \n- Routine operational details, JORC compliance tables, and non-material assay data.  \n\n**Summary**: Focus on Kurundi\u2019s new gold intercept and Kuiper\u2019s IOCG pathfinders, with drilling pending. No capital or liquidity impacts noted.",
