  "summary": "### Material Information Summary (G50 Corp Limited - ASX: G50)  \n\n#### **Amended Announcement (14 July 2025)**  \n- **Retraction**: Metal equivalent data in the original 10 July 2025 announcement is withdrawn for non-compliance with JORC Code Section 50. Investors are advised to disregard it.  \n- **Key Drill Results Remain Valid**: Confirmed significant gold, silver, zinc, and gallium intersections at the Golconda Project (Arizona).  \n\n#### **Drilling Results Highlights**  \n- **GRC22**: 47.2m at **2.0 g/t Au**, **40.2 g/t Ag**, and 0.29% Zn (includes 16.8m at 5.19 g/t Au, 100.2 g/t Ag).  \n- **GRC21**: 77.7m at **0.76 g/t Au**, 11 g/t Ag (includes 7.6m at 5.5 g/t Au).  \n- **GRC17**: 97.5m at **0.27 g/t Au**, 4.8 g/t Ag, and 0.7% Zn.  \n- **Gallium Intercepts**: Consistently high grades (e.g., GRC13: 216m at **18.4 g/t Ga**).  \n\n#### **Geological Significance**  \n- Discovery confirms a **broad, shallow, continuous mineralized zone** at Golconda, open along strike and at depth.  \n- Mineralization linked to quartz-sulphide veins (pyrite, sphalerite, galena).  \n\n#### **Next Steps**  \n- Assays pending for 12 additional holes (GRC27\u201338).  \n- Planning underway for **follow-up drilling** to extend mineralization.  \n\n#### **Strategic Context**  \n- Gallium mineralization (strategic metal) in altered granite may support future domestic supply.  \n\n**No capital raising, valuation-impacting transactions, or liquidity changes disclosed.**  \n\n---  \n*Brevity Rule*: Omitted routine operational details, director statements, and non-material JORC tables. Focused on drill results and retraction of non-compliant data.",
