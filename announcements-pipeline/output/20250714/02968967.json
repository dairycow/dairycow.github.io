  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Operational Update & Financial Position**  \n- **Reduced production** at Burton Mine Complex due to depressed coal prices (PLV HCC spot: ~US$177/t), high costs, and royalties.  \n- Transitioned to **owner-operator model** (since July 2025) with reduced fleet (2 excavators vs. 4).  \n- Targeting **~0.5Mt ROM coal** in September 2025 at low strip ratio (<3:1).  \n- **Cash balance (unaudited):** $45M (includes $19M restricted cash) as of 11 July 2025.  \n\n#### **Financing & Liquidity**  \n- Actively pursuing **refinancing** (debt/equity/hybrid solutions) to address liquidity; advisors appointed.  \n- Ongoing negotiations with **creditors** (secured/unsecured) and Queensland Revenue Office.  \n\n#### **Market Conditions**  \n- Metallurgical coal prices volatile (recent drop to US$177/t); weak demand from China and steel oversupply.  \n- Thermal coal prices fell ~7% in June 2025 (US$67/t for 5500 NAR).  \n\n#### **Risk**  \n- Operations may pause if coal prices don\u2019t recover or refinancing fails.  \n\nNo capital raising, M&A, or material asset transactions announced.",
