  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement: Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) Notice \u2013 Articore Group Limited  \n\n#### **Key Material Information**:  \n1. **EGM Called by Shareholders**  \n   - Requested by shareholders holding **\u22655% of issued capital**, seeking to replace the entire Board with four new directors (including former Chair Richard Cawsey).  \n\n2. **Board Recommendation**  \n   - **Unanimously opposes all resolutions** to remove current directors (Mendelson, Low, Sherwin, Lewis) and elect new candidates.  \n   - Argues the requisitioning shareholders lack a strategic plan, and a geographically concentrated (Australia-only) Board risks undermining global operations (90% revenue offshore).  \n\n3. **Turnaround Progress**  \n   - New CEO Vivek Kumar has improved **1HFY25 gross profit margin (+220bps YoY)** and reaffirmed FY25 guidance.  \n   - Strategic review underway for **capital structure, portfolio positioning, and cost efficiencies**.  \n\n4. **EGM Details**  \n   - **Date**: 22 August 2025 (10:00 AEST).  \n   - **Voting Deadline**: 20 August 2025 (10:00 AEST).  \n\n#### **Impact**:  \n- High-stakes governance battle; outcome could shift strategy and leadership continuity amid a turnaround.  \n\n**Omitted**: Director bios, legal boilerplate, requisitioning shareholders' statements (no materially new strategy proposed).",
