  "summary": "### **Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) Summary \u2013 Articore Group Limited**  \n\n#### **Key Material Information:**  \n- **EGM Requested by:** 5%+ shareholder group (including former Chair Richard Cawsey and ex-CEO Martin Hosking) to remove the entire board and appoint four new directors.  \n- **EGM Date:** 22 August 2025 (virtual meeting).  \n- **Board Recommendation:** **Vote AGAINST all resolutions** (removal of current directors and appointment of requisitioning shareholders\u2019 nominees).  \n- **Rationale:**  \n  - Current board argues proposed new directors lack global experience (90% of revenue is offshore) and continuity.  \n  - No alternate strategy presented by requisitioning shareholders.  \n  - Turnaround under new CEO (Vivek Kumar) showing progress:  \n    - 1HFY25 gross margin highest to date (+220bps YoY).  \n    - Cost synergies achieved; FY25 guidance reaffirmed (11 June 2025).  \n  - Strategic review underway (capital structure/portfolio optimization).  \n\n#### **Trading Implications:**  \n- Potential board overhaul could disrupt turnaround momentum.  \n- Monitor shareholder vote outcome (22 Aug) for governance risk signals.  \n\n**No material capital raising, financials, or trading halt details identified.**  \n\n**Note:** Excludes director bios, legal details, and procedural EGM logistics.",
