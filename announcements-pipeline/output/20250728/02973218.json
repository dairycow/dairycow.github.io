  "summary": "- **Alternative Takeover Proposal**: Unsolicited, conditional, non-binding cash offer of **A$3.70 per unit** (total ~A$184M) for Reef Casino Trust (RCT) by Morris Group.  \n- **Competing Bid**: Morris Group\u2019s terms are substantially similar to the existing Iris Offer (announced 14 July 2025).  \n- **Key Condition**: Proposal includes separate acquisition of Casinos Austria International (Cairns) Pty Ltd and RCSL by Morris Group, requiring negotiated share purchase agreements.  \n- **Board Assessment**: Independent Board Committee evaluating feasibility and timeframe for Morris Group\u2019s conditions versus Iris Offer.  \n- **No Action Advised**: Unitholders urged to await further updates due to Iris\u2019s right to match competing proposals under the existing agreement.  \n- **Current Recommendation**: RCT directors maintain support for Iris Offer unless a superior proposal emerges.  \n\n*Omitted: Adviser details, background on RCT, routine disclaimers.*",
