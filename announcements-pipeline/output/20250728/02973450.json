  "summary": "**Material Information Summary**  \n\n**1. General Meeting Details**  \n- **Date:** 26 August 2025  \n- **Purpose:** Approval of key resolutions related to an acquisition and capital raising.  \n\n**2. Acquisition of Boa Vista Gold Project (Resolution 1)**  \n- **Transaction:** Earn-in agreement for up to 80% of Boa Vista Gold Project (Brazil).  \n- **Consideration:**  \n  - Initial issue of **100,451,592 shares** (A$1.0m at A$0.008/share) to vendors (Majestic and Cabral).  \n  - Future staged earn-in via exploration spend ($4.5m over 3 years) and milestone-linked share issuances (potential further **125M\u20132.5B shares**, depending on share price and resource targets).  \n- **Key Conditions:** Shareholder approval for share issuance under ASX Listing Rule 7.1.  \n\n**3. Capital Raising (Resolutions 2.1\u20132.2, 3.1\u20133.2)**  \n- **Placement:** Completed issuance of **312.5M shares** at A$0.008/share (27.3% discount to last close) raising **A$2.5m**.  \n  - **Use of funds:** A$2m (exploration), A$0.35m (working capital), A$0.15m (expenses).  \n- **Options:**  \n  - **156.25M placement options** (1:2 free-attaching, strike A$0.022, expiry Feb 2027).  \n  - **15M broker options** (same terms).  \n- **Shareholder approval sought** for options issuance (ASX Listing Rule 7.1).  \n\n**4. Timetable**  \n- **General Meeting:** 26 August 2025 (record date: 24 August 2025).  \n\n**5. Key Risks/Dilution**  \n- Significant dilution risk from future share issuances linked to earn-in milestones.  \n- Early-stage project with no JORC-compliant resource; foreign estimate only (336koz Au inferred).  \n\n**Omitted:** Routine procedural details, director names, legal disclaimers.  \n\n**Valuation Impact:**  \n- Potential upside from gold diversification but high dilution and jurisdictional/operational risks. Capital structure to expand if all milestones met.  \n\n**TL;DR:** Major vote on Brazil gold project acquisition (up to 80% via shares) + ratification of A$2.5m placement/options. High dilution risk.",
