  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:\n\n- **Upcoming Drilling Campaign**:  \n  - Extensive drilling planned at Croydon Gold Project (Pilbara, WA), targeting new anomalies and extensions of known high-grade gold mineralization.  \n  - Initial program includes ~180 aircore holes (testing 6km gravity anomaly) and ~20 RC holes (testing Hemi-style intrusions and shallow gold zones).  \n  - Scheduled to start in September 2025, pending completion of Robe Mesa sale.  \n\n- **Historical High-Grade Intercepts** (2019\u20132020 drilling):  \n  - **Top Camp**: 27m @ 3.2g/t Au (incl. 8m @ 10.0g/t Au); 2m @ 22g/t Au.  \n  - **Bottom Camp**: 8m @ 1.7g/t Au (incl. 1m @ 9.4g/t Au).  \n  - Mineralization remains open in all directions.  \n\n- **Funding**: Fully funded via proceeds from $75M Robe Mesa project sale (pending completion).  \n\n- **Strategic Context**:  \n  - Croydon is along strike from Northern Star\u2019s 11.2Moz Hemi deposit, with similar geological/structural setting.  \n  - Targets include shallow high-grade gold and potential large-scale intrusive systems at depth.  \n\n- **Key Risks/Forward Work**:  \n  - Drill results pending; success hinges on confirming Hemi-style mineralization.  \n  - Commercialization dependent on Robe Mesa sale closing.  \n\n**Omitted**: Non-material operational details, director quotes, regional maps, JORC tables, and appendices.",
