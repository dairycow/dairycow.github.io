  "summary": "This appears to be a product disclosure document for **CitiFirst Instalment MINIs** (a type of structured equity product). Below are the material details for trading and capital markets participants:\n\n### Key Product Features:\n- **Interest Rate**: Current rate is **8.30% p.a.** (paid to investors where applicable).  \n- **Effective Date**: **29-Jul-25** (for pricing/terms).  \n- **Structure**: Instalment MINIs (geared equity derivatives), where investors pay an initial instalment and owe the remaining loan amount at expiry.  \n- **Dividend Treatment**: Most pay dividends to investors (indicated as *\"Pay to investor\"*), while some pay down the loan (*\"Pay down loan\"*).  \n\n### Trading Considerations:\n- **Gearing Levels**: Vary widely (e.g., **10.07%\u201384.42%**), impacting leverage and risk.  \n- **Stop Loss Triggers**: Automatic exit if the underlying share price falls to the trigger level (e.g., **AGLJOA** stops at **$9.78**, currently **46.41% above trigger**).  \n- **Expiry Dates**: Range from **2025 to 2035**, with most expiring **2026\u20132033**.  \n\n### Example Highlights (for select MINIs):\n| MINI Code  | Underlying Stock  | First Instalment (AUD) | Final Loan (AUD) | Stop Loss (AUD) | Gearing | Expiry       | Indicative Dividend Yield |\n|------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| A2MJOB     | A2 Milk Co        | $4.60                 | $4.07           | $8.01           | 42.60%  | 26-May-2026  | 1.69%                     |\n| CBAJOA     | CBA               | $125.52               | $139.69         | $174.90         | 71.77%  | 25-Sep-2025  | 9.62%                     |\n| BHPJOA     | BHP Group         | $25.32                | $28.93          | $40.30          | 62.83%  | 21-Jan-2032  | 12.53%                    |\n| FMGJOC     | Fortescue Metals  | $8.01                 | $9.15           | $18.14          | 44.14%  | 06-Feb-2035  | 13.72%                    |\n\n### Risk Notes:\n- **High-Geared MINIs** (e.g., **TCLJOC** at **81.54% gearing**) are more sensitive to underlying price moves.  \n- **Low Buffer to Stop Loss**: Some MINIs are close to triggers (e.g., **ANZJOB** has **14.55% buffer**).  \n\n### Actionable Takeaway:\nTraders should assess gearing, expiry, dividend yields, and proximity to stop-loss levels when evaluating these instruments.  \n\n**No material corporate actions, capital raisings, or operational updates identified.** Focus is purely on product terms.",
