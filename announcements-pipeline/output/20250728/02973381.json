  "summary": "Here\u2019s the concise material information from the ASX announcement, tailored for trading and capital markets decisions:\n\n### **Quarterly Report (Appendix 4C/5B) Highlights**  \n- **Cash balance (30 June 2025):** **A$8.88M** (A$8M in term deposits).  \n- **Key operational updates:**  \n  - **Strategic pivot:** Slowed Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS) and approvals to conserve cash due to low vanadium prices (expected to persist 2\u20133 years).  \n  - **Focus areas:**  \n    - Metallurgical test work for direct vanadium electrolyte production (potential cost savings).  \n    - Reserve drilling for higher-grade inventory.  \n    - BFS completion delayed to H2 2026.  \n    - VFB demonstration plant with partners (Rongke Power/Trina Solar) targeted for 2026.  \n- **Board changes:** MD and Technical Director stepped down; Executive Chair assumes leadership to cut costs.  \n- **Market context:** Secondary vanadium supply (China) meets current VFB demand; long-term growth outlook tied to energy transition.  \n- **Cash runway:** ~13.6 quarters at current burn rate (A$652K outflow this quarter).  \n\n### **Other Material Points**  \n- **Termination:** Ended agreement with Thorion Energy (simplifying capital structure).  \n- **Tenements:** No changes to key project holdings (5 Queensland tenements).  \n\n*No capital raising or trading halt details identified.*",
