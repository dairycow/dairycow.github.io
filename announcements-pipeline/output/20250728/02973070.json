  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Metallurgical Testwork Results (Gradina Deposit, Rogozna Project):**  \n  - Gold recoveries up to **97.9%** (average **89.9%**) using standard flotation methods.  \n  - Confirms viability of gold-pyrite concentrate production, with average concentrate grade of **26.1 g/t Au**.  \n  - Outlier sample (64.3% recovery) due to rare oxidised mineralization.  \n  - **Next steps:** Further testwork to optimize concentrate grades and LOM specifications.  \n\n- **Exploration Update:**  \n  - Ongoing drilling (8 rigs total): 4 rigs at Gradina targeting maiden **Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) by late 2025**.  \n  - Assays pending for Kotlovi, Gradina, and Shanac prospects.  \n\n- **Mineral Resource Context (Rogozna Project):**  \n  - Total inferred resources: **7.40Moz AuEq** across Gradina, Shanac, Medenovac, and Copper Canyon deposits.  \n\n**Omitted:** Operational details, director comments, non-material testwork specifics, and JORC-code boilerplate.  \n\n**Announcement Type:** *Exploration/Metallurgical Results* \u2013 Key focus on de-risking Gradina\u2019s gold extraction potential and progress toward MRE.",
