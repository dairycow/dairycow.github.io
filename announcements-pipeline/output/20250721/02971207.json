  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (Form 604 - Change in Substantial Holding)  \n\n**Material Information:**  \n- **Substantial Holder:** State Street Bank and Trust Company and affiliates (e.g., State Street Global Advisors entities).  \n- **Voting Power Change:**  \n  - Previous voting power: **8.08%**  \n  - Current voting power: **7.06%** (net decrease of **1.02%**).  \n- **Nature of Changes:**  \n  - Primarily driven by **collateral adjustments** and **securities lending/borrowing activities** under Global Master Securities Lending Agreements.  \n  - Transactions include both **increases and decreases** in holdings, with net reduction in voting interests.  \n- **Key Dates:**  \n  - Changes occurred between **15-Jul-2025** and **17-Jul-2025**.  \n- **Securities Lending Details:**  \n  - No early recall rights for lenders (unless borrower defaults or returns securities).  \n  - No fixed return date; collateral returned upon loan termination.  \n\n**Actionable Insight:**  \n- **Monitoring Implications:** Reduced voting power suggests potential portfolio rebalancing or client-driven adjustments by State Street. Lending activity indicates normal market operations (no forced selling).  \n\n*No material capital markets impact identified beyond routine institutional adjustments.*",
