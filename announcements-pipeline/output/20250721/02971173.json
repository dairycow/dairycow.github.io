  "summary": "- **Document Type**: ASX Cleansing Notice Query Response  \n- **Key Points**:  \n  - Company confirms **no material price-sensitive information** was omitted from prior cleansing notice (7 July 2025).  \n  - **Announcement on 9 July 2025** regarding metallurgical test results (e.g., gold recoveries up to 85%) was deemed **non-material**, as results were consistent with prior disclosures (4 Aug 2023, 1 July 2025) and part of ongoing PFS work.  \n  - Final PFS results expected in **Q4 2025** (Whittle optimization study, heap leach, and mining cost models still pending).  \n  - Company **not relying on Listing Rule 3.1A** for non-disclosure but maintains cautious \"price sensitive\" tagging practice.  \n\n- **Conclusion**: No actionable trading or capital markets impact identified; reiterates procedural compliance.",
