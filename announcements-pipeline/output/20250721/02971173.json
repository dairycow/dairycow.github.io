  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement:  \n\n**Type:** **Cleansing Notice Dispute / Continuous Disclosure Clarification**  \n\n#### Material Points:  \n- **Disputed Materiality**: Challenger Gold Limited (CEL) contends that the metallurgical test results disclosed in its 9 July 2025 announcement (e.g., gold recoveries of up to 85%, average 75%) are **not material** under Listing Rule 3.1, as they:  \n  - Represent interim updates to ongoing PFS work (final results expected Q4 2025).  \n  - Align with prior disclosures (e.g., August 2023 results, July 2025 investor presentation).  \n  - Do not materially differ from earlier test results (\u00bc-inch vs. \u00bd-inch/1-inch columns).  \n- **Timing of Awareness**: CEL became aware of the unreported test results (\u00bd-inch and 1-inch columns) on **11 March 2025** but did not deem them price-sensitive.  \n- **No Cleansing Notice Inclusion**: CEL argues the results were part of an incomplete program (Whittle Enterprise Optimization Study, Heap Leach models) and thus not required for investor assessment.  \n- **Compliance Claim**: CEL asserts adherence to Listing Rules, including Rule 3.1, and states no reliance on Rule 3.1A carve-outs.  \n\n#### **No Material Trading or Capital Impact Identified**:  \n- No capital raising, operational/financial results, or liquidity changes disclosed. Dispute centres on disclosure classification, not new material data.  \n\n**Key Takeaway**: ASX challenged CEL\u2019s discretion to withhold test results; CEL defends its position, emphasizing the non-materiality of incremental data. No immediate market action warranted.",
