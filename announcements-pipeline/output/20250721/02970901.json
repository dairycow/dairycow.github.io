  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (AusQuest Limited - Exploration Update - Cangallo Copper Project):  \n\n#### **Material Information for Trading/Capital Markets Decisions**:  \n\n- **Exploration Results**:  \n  - Multiple wide copper-gold intercepts reported in first four of 13 planned RC drill holes (e.g., **324m @ 0.30% Cu, 0.07ppm Au**).  \n  - Mineralization starts near surface, remains open at depth and laterally.  \n  - Porphyry center not yet intersected\u2014potential for higher grades in future drilling.  \n\n- **Metallurgical Results**:  \n  - Preliminary leach tests show **60\u201380% copper recovery** in 7/10 samples; acid consumption low to moderate (<28 kg/t).  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Stage 2 drilling completion by **end-July 2025**; assays for remaining holes expected by **end-August 2025**.  \n  - Diamond drilling planned for **late August 2025** to target depth/extensions.  \n  - Stage 3 RC drilling permits pending (targeting southern extension).  \n\n- **Scale Potential**:  \n  - Evidence of multiple porphyry centers; new surface samples suggest mineralized zone extends **1.2km south** of current drilling.  \n\n#### **Non-Material Omissions**:  \n- JORC tables, director commentary, general project background.  \n\n**Trading Implication**: Positive assay results and leach recoveries may support investor sentiment, but further drilling is critical to confirm scale/grade.",
