  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:\n- **Drilling Results:**  \n  - **9,538m** of new drilling completed at Lac Carheil, adding **4,995m** of graphitic carbon intervals (~595% increase from prior drilling).  \n  - **52% of drilled meters** yielded graphite intercepts.  \n\n- **New SE Extension Zone:**  \n  - **2,777m** of graphite intercepts confirmed, with a **weighted mean grade of 12.4% TGC**.  \n  - **72% of intercepts** exceed the current MRE average grade of 11.5% TGC.  \n\n- **Original SE Resource Zone:**  \n  - **1,508m** of new graphite intercepts added, with a **weighted mean grade of 11.9% TGC**.  \n\n- **Connector Zone:**  \n  - **710m** of graphite intercepts confirmed, linking SE and NW zones, with **9.0% TGC** average grade.  \n\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - **Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) update** expected **this quarter**.  \n  - **Mining consultant (DRA Americas)** appointed to advance Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS), including mine planning and infrastructure design.  \n\n- **Grant Funding:**  \n  - **~A$660k** awarded by Quebec government for R&D related to graphite processing.  \n\n**No capital raising, trading halt, or financial figures (e.g., cash balance) disclosed.**  \n\n*Omitted: Non-material operational details, background, and JORC compliance text.*",
