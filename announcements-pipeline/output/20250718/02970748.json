Compliance with regulatory obligations confirmed.  \n\n**Conclusion**: Insufficient material information for trading or capital markets decisions. Further details required (e.g., Appendix 2A contents).  \n\n*Note:* If Appendix 2A was attached, it would typically include the number of securities issued, issue price, and recipient details, which would be material. Since it wasn\u2019t provided, only the regulatory context is noted.",
