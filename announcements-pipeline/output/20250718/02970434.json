  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Updated Mineral Resource Estimate:**  \n  - Total resource: **137.1 Mt @ 0.51 g/t Au for 2,239,000 oz** (10% increase from prior 2.03Moz).  \n  - **Measured & Indicated (M&I) resource:** **1.84Moz (82% of total**, up 59% from prior update).  \n  - Cut-off grade: **0.20 g/t Au**, constrained within a Whittle pit shell (A$3,550/oz gold price assumption).  \n\n- **Drilling & Model Updates:**  \n  - **55,757m of new drilling (300 RC + 9 DD holes)** since February 2025 resource update.  \n  - Refined block model with **smaller selective mining unit (10m x 25m x 10m)** for improved grade selectivity.  \n\n- **Project Development:**  \n  - **Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS)** targeted for late 2025, supporting inaugural Ore Reserve.  \n  - **Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)** and updated Ore Reserve targeted for 2026.  \n\n- **Exploration Potential:**  \n  - Mineralization remains **open along strike and at depth**.  \n  - Ongoing drilling to expand resources and test regional targets across ~1,000 km\u00b2 tenure.  \n\n- **Metallurgy:**  \n  - Heap leach recovery estimates: **75% for primary ore**, with ongoing optimization tests.  \n\n**No capital raising or trading halt disclosed.**  \n\n*(Note: Excluded routine operational/background details; focused solely on material valuation, liquidity, or capital structure impacts.)*",
