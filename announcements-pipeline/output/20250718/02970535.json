  "summary": "**Key Points from Emyria's Less than Marketable Parcel (LMP) Sale Facility Announcement:**  \n\n- **Facility Type:** Share sale facility for holders of unmarketable parcels (<17,241 shares, valued <A$500 as of 15 July 2025).  \n- **Purpose:** Reduce administrative costs; enables cost-effective disposal without brokerage fees (costs borne by Company).  \n- **Impact:** 1,924 shareholders (56% of total) hold LMPs (aggregate 12,368,609 shares).  \n- **Key Dates:**  \n  - Record Date: 15 July 2025 (5:00pm WST).  \n  - Closing Date for Retention Election: 1 September 2025 (5:00pm WST).  \n  - Proceeds Payment: Post-sale, timing TBD.  \n- **Election Required:** Shareholders must actively elect to *retain* shares (via online portal or mailed form) or increase holdings to \u226517,242 shares by Closing Date; otherwise, automatic sale.  \n- **Exclusion:** Sold shares disqualify holders from upcoming Loyalty Options bonus issue (per 18 June 2025 announcement).  \n- **Broker:** GBA Capital appointed for on-market sales; sale price averaged across all LMP transactions.  \n\n**Material Impact:**  \n- Potential liquidity event for small holders; minor float adjustment (~12.4M shares, ~2.9% of issued capital at A$0.029/share).  \n- Administrative cost savings for Emyria; no direct capital raising or dilution.",
