  "summary": "- **Key Points from Announcement:**  \n  - **Takeover Panel Application**: Kinterra Capital challenges NWC\u2019s proposed $10M placement, alleging it could frustrate a potential competing bid.  \n  - **Voluntary Suspension**: NWC sought suspension pending:  \n    1. Revised scheme terms (potential increased offer from CAML).  \n    2. Placement to fund Antler Project development (regulatory bonding/land acquisition).  \n  - **Panel Status**: No interim order issued; Panel may intervene later if placement deemed unacceptable.  \n\n**Material Implications**:  \n- Risk of delayed/disrupted capital raising if Panel blocks placement.  \n- Potential for competing bid (Kinterra holds 11.99%, opposes placement as \"frustrating action\").",
