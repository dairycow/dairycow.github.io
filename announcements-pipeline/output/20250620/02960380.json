  "summary": "- **US Budget Bill Impact**: Draft US Senate version proposes a statutory tax on legal finance transactions (House version does not). Bill remains in early legislative stages with significant uncertainty.  \n- **Portfolio Exposure**: If enacted, <25% of Omni Bridgeway\u2019s global investment portfolio fair value potentially exposed. Contracts include protections to mitigate tax impact.  \n- **Market Impact**: If passed, tax would broadly affect US legal finance providers, increasing costs; minimal expected disruption to Omni Bridgeway\u2019s core high-return segment.  \n- **Diversification**: Portfolio structured to limit idiosyncratic risks across geographies and legal jurisdictions.  \n\n*No material trading or capital markets actions identified.*",
