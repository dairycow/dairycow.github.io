  "summary": "**Summary of ASX Announcement: Cyclone Metals Limited \u2013 Power Study for Iron Bear Project**  \n\n### **Material Information for Capital Markets/Trading Decisions:**  \n- **Project De-risking:** Power Study confirms **100% renewable energy** (hydropower + wind) feasibility for Iron Bear Project, reducing operational and ESG risks.  \n- **Key CAPEX/OPEX Estimates (CAD, Class 5 \u00b150% accuracy):**  \n  - **Phase 1 (10 Mtpa, COD 2031-32):** CAPEX **CAD 1,613M** (range: 806\u20132,219M), OPEX **CAD 21M/year**, unit power cost **CAD 0.023/kWh**.  \n  - **Phase 2 (25 Mtpa, COD 2035-36):** CAPEX **CAD 3,365M** (range: 1,682\u20136,730M), OPEX **CAD 85M/year**, unit power cost **CAD 0.041/kWh**.  \n  - **Phase 3 (50 Mtpa, COD 2038-39):** CAPEX **CAD 4,438M** (range: 3,226\u20138,876M), OPEX **CAD 3M/year** (typo noted; likely higher), unit power cost **CAD 0.047/kWh**.  \n- **Funding Risk:** Total funding required ranges **CAD 800M\u20138,800M**; no certainty of raising capital, potential dilution or JV/sale of project.  \n- **Upcoming Catalysts:**  \n  - Scoping Study due **June 2025**.  \n  - Summer 2025 drilling program to expand Mineral Resources.  \n- **Cautionary Notes:** Study is **preliminary** (\u00b150% accuracy); further work needed for economic viability.  \n\n**Actionable Insight:** Positive de-risking milestone with renewable energy solution, but high funding uncertainty and long-term horizons (COD from 2031). Watch for Scoping Study results.  \n\n*Omitted: Technical assumptions, director quotes, legal disclaimers.*",
