  "summary": "- **Preclinical Data Confirms Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration**: NUZ-001 and its metabolite NUZ-001 Sulfone achieved brain concentrations (285\u20131,300 nM and 177\u20131,231 nM, respectively) in rodents, overlapping with therapeutic levels shown to reverse TDP-43 aggregation in ALS models.  \n- **TDP-43 Aggregation Reversal**: Both compounds significantly prevented TDP-43 aggregation in patient-derived neuronal cells at all tested concentrations (270\u20134,400 nM), reinforcing potential efficacy in ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies.  \n- **Broad Therapeutic Implications**: Results support NUZ-001\u2019s potential across neurodegenerative diseases (ALS, FTD, AD, LATE), validating its CNS-targeted mechanism.",
