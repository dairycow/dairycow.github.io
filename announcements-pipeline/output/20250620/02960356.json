  "summary": "- **Key preclinical results**:  \n  - NUZ-001 and its metabolite NUZ-001 Sulfone demonstrated effective blood-brain barrier penetration in rodent studies, achieving brain concentrations (285\u20131,300 nM for NUZ-001; 177\u20131,231 nM for NUZ-001 Sulfone) overlapping with therapeutic levels shown to reverse TDP-43 aggregation in ALS models.  \n  - Both compounds significantly prevented TDP-43 aggregation (*p* < 0.05) at all tested concentrations (270\u20134,400 nM) in patient-derived iPSC neuronal models.  \n\n- **Therapeutic implications**:  \n  - Validates NUZ-001\u2019s potential as a disease-modifying therapy for ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies (e.g., FTD, Alzheimer\u2019s).  \n  - Supports advancement of NUZ-001\u2019s clinical development.  \n\n*No material trading or capital markets actions announced.*",
