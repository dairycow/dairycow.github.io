  "summary": "- **Key preclinical findings**:  \n  - NUZ-001 and its metabolite (NUZ-001 Sulfone) demonstrated significant blood-brain barrier penetration in rodent studies, achieving brain concentrations (285\u20131,300 nM for NUZ-001; 177\u20131,231 nM for NUZ-001 Sulfone) that overlap with therapeutic ranges.  \n  - Both compounds significantly reduced TDP-43 aggregation in ALS patient-derived neuron models at concentrations as low as 270 nM.  \n\n- **Therapeutic implications**:  \n  - Validates NUZ-001\u2019s potential as a disease-modifying therapy for ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies (e.g., FTD, Alzheimer\u2019s).  \n  - Supports advancing NUZ-001\u2019s clinical development as a CNS-targeted treatment.  \n\n- **No capital markets or trading-specific information** (e.g., capital raising, timelines) disclosed.  \n\n*Note: Announcement is a preclinical data update; no direct trading or capital structure impact.*",
