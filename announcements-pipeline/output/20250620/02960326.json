  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n1. **Drilling Results Highlights:**  \n   - High-grade silver intercepts confirmed at La Negra prospect (Joaquin Project), including:  \n     - **JDD005-25:** 28m at 507g/t Ag (522g/t AgEq) from 33m, including **7m at 1,452g/t Ag (1,474g/t AgEq)**.  \n     - **JRC024-25:** 53m at 135g/t Ag (161g/t AgEq) from 76m, including 7m at 460g/t Ag (472g/t AgEq).  \n   - Intercepts support conversion of a 2013 Foreign Estimate to JORC-compliant Resource (targeted for Q3 2025).  \n\n2. **Resource Development:**  \n   - Drilling aims to upgrade the **73Moz AgEq Foreign Estimate** (16.7Mt at 136g/t AgEq) at Joaquin to JORC standards.  \n   - Focus on shallow, high-grade \"manto-style\" silver zones, enhancing geological model confidence.  \n\n3. **Next Steps:**  \n   - Phase 1 drilling (~10,000m) concludes June 2025; results for 30 pending holes expected July 2025.  \n   - Regional exploration resumes August 2025, targeting extensions to the **PLUS 150 Exploration Target** (123\u2013176Moz AgEq).  \n\n4. **Key Metrics:**  \n   - **Cerro Leon Project (JORC-compliant):** 91Moz AgEq (16.5Mt at 172g/t AgEq).  \n   - **Joaquin Historical Production (2019\u20132022):** 4.3Moz Ag.  \n\n**Notes:** No capital raising, trading halt, or material liquidity/capital structure changes disclosed. Focus remains on resource growth and grade confirmation.",
