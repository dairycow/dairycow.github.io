  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Exploration Results**:  \n  - LiDAR and SAM surveys identified a **+4km VMS target corridor** at the Mt Everest\u2013Mona Mine trend.  \n  - **High-grade copper mineralization** confirmed:  \n    - **Partial sulphides**: Up to **8.19% Cu**  \n    - **Supergene mineralization**: Up to **24.2% Cu**  \n    - **Gold/silver/cobalt byproducts**: Up to **0.95 g/t Au, 29.1 g/t Ag, 508 ppm Co**.  \n  - **Historic mining** evidence suggests untested primary sulphides below known workings.  \n  - **New magnetic horizons** identified as potential vectors for concealed VMS deposits.  \n\nFortcoming Work:  \n- **Follow-up rock chip sampling** (focusing on Mona Mine).  \n- **Soil sampling/mapping program** to define drill targets.  \n- **Drilling planned** for untested VMS targets (no prior drilling in the area).  \n\n**No material financial, capital structure, or trading-related updates identified.**  \n\n*(Note: This is an exploration update; no capital raising, financial results, or corporate actions were announced.)*",
