  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n**Exploration Update Announcement:**  \n- **Antimony Targets (Desert Antimony Mine - DAM):**  \n  - Confirmed up to three antimony-rich veins in a NNE-SSW corridor, expanding mineralised footprint.  \n  - E-W structures identified as potential secondary mineralisation paths.  \n  - Plan of Operations (POO) for expanded RC drilling to be submitted late July 2025; approval expected early September.  \n\n- **REE Targets (El Campo):**  \n  - Steep (70\u201380\u00b0 SW dip) REE-bearing shear zone confirmed, favorable for underground mining.  \n  - New **South Fault** mapped as additional exploration target.  \n  - Historical sampling may have under-tested high-grade REE zones.  \n\n- **Strategic Context:**  \n  - Proximity to **MP Materials\u2019 Mountain Pass mine** (1.4km away) highlighted following Apple\u2019s **US$500M investment** in domestic rare earth supply chain.  \n\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - **Q3 2025 drilling program** planned for DAM and El Campo (including South Fault).  \n  - 3D geological models completed to refine JORC Exploration Targets.  \n\n**No capital raising, financials, or trading halt details identified.**  \n\n*(Summary excludes non-material operational/background details.)*",
