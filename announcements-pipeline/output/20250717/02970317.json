  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (Form 605 - Ceasing to be a Substantial Holder):  \n\n- **Substantial Holder**: State Street Bank and Trust Company and its subsidiaries (collectively \"State Street\")  \n- **Company**: Capricorn Metals Ltd  \n- **Key Event**: State Street ceased to be a substantial holder in Capricorn Metals Ltd on **15-Jul-2025**.  \n- **Previous Notice Date**: Last substantial holding notice was dated **12-Jun-2025** (submitted 16-Jun-2025).  \n\n### Material Changes in Relevant Interests (Annexure A):  \n- **Net Changes**: Series of transactions (collateral transfers, lending, and returns) in Capricorn Metals ordinary shares between **13-Jun-2025 and 15-Jul-2025**.  \n- **Significant Transactions**:  \n  - Largest single reduction: **-750,000 shares** (07-Jul-2025) via securities lending.  \n  - Other notable reductions: **-518,000 shares** (20-Jun-2025), **-726,909 shares** (14-Jul-2025).  \n  - Some offsetting increases (e.g., **+653,519 shares** on 26-Jun-2025).  \n\n### Context (Annexures B & C):  \n- **Securities Lending**: Transactions primarily driven by State Street\u2019s securities lending program under **Global Master Securities Lending Agreements**.  \n  - No scheduled return dates; lender/borrower may recall/return shares at any time.  \n  - Voting rights typically retained by lender unless default occurs.  \n\n### Impact:  \n- **Liquidity/Shares on Loan**: Increased trading volume likely due to lending activity.  \n- **Capital Markets Implication**: Reduction in substantial holding may signal reduced institutional exposure, but likely reflects routine securities lending adjustments rather than a strategic divestment.  \n\n**Conclusion**: No immediate trading catalyst, but monitoring further filings for sustained changes in ownership.  \n\n*Format note: Excluded granular transaction details (e.g., minor collateral movements) per conciseness rules.*",
