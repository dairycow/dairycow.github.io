  "summary": "- **Notice of General Meeting \u2013 Key Points**:  \n  - **Conditional Buyback Resolution**: If shareholders reject the proposed Scheme of Arrangement (requiring 75% vote approval), an on-market buyback of up to **148.3 million shares (~50% of issued capital)** will be sought.  \n  - **Voting Threshold**: Buyback requires a simple majority (50%+1) at the General Meeting on **12 August 2025**.  \n  - **Major Shareholder Opposition**: L1 Capital (16.85% holder) opposes the Scheme, increasing likelihood of buyback activation.  \n\n- **Material Impact**:  \n  - **Liquidity Mechanism**: Buyback aims to address persistent NTA discount, offering exit opportunity if Scheme fails.  \n  - **Control Risk**: If L1 Capital does not participate, their stake could effectively double to 33.7%, enabling blocking of future special resolutions.  \n\n**Omitted**: Explanatory notes, proxy logistics, and general meeting procedural details.",
