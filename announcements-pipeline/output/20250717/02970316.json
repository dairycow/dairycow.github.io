  "summary": "### Summary of Material Information:\n\n- **Scheme of Arrangement Vote Outcome Contingency**: If the Scheme is not approved at the 12 August 2025 meeting, a subsequent general meeting will seek approval for an **on-market buyback of up to 148,341,842 shares (~50% of issued capital)**.  \n- **Voting Thresholds**:  \n  - **Scheme Approval**: Requires **75% of votes cast** and **50% of voting shareholders**.  \n  - **Buyback Resolution**: Ordinary resolution (majority >50% of votes cast).  \n- **Key Dates**:  \n  - **Record Date for Voting**: 10 August 2025.  \n  - **General Meeting (if Scheme fails)**: 12 August 2025 at 1:30pm (Sydney time).  \n- **Buyback Conditions**: Only proceeds if the Scheme is rejected. Pricing will be **below NTA**, subject to ASX Listing Rule 7.33 (\u22645% above 5-day VWAP).  \n- **Shareholder Impact**: L1 Capital (16.85% holder) opposes the Scheme; their non-participation in the buyback could increase their voting power to **up to 33.7%** post-buyback.  \n\n**Material Omissions**: No financial terms or NTA figures disclosed in the announcement.  \n**Actionable Insight**: Monitor Scheme vote outcome on 12 August 2025 for capital structure implications.",
