  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (ASX: SVY) \u2013 Exploration Update**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights**  \n- **Significant Gold Intercepts:**  \n  - **Fairview North:**  \n    - **59m @ 1.31g/t Au** (from surface), including **27m @ 2.33g/t Au** and **3m @ 10.81g/t Au**.  \n    - **42m @ 1.57g/t Au** (from 23m), including **8m @ 4.76g/t Au**.  \n  - **Fairview South (previously reported):**  \n    - **40m @ 1.96g/t Au** (from surface), including **9m @ 7.15g/t Au**.  \n\n- **Metallurgical Testwork:**  \n  - **Heap Leach Potential:** 80%+ gold recoveries demonstrated in column/bottle-roll tests.  \n  - Gravity recovery improved overall recoveries to **85\u201395.3%**.  \n\n- **Exploration Upside:**  \n  - Fairview North and South form part of a **+10km mineralised structure**.  \n  - Planned follow-up RC drilling at Flexure Zones A, B, and C.  \n\n#### **Conclusion**  \nDrilling confirms **shallow, broad, heap-leachable gold mineralisation** with high-grade zones. Metallurgical tests support low-cost extraction potential. Further drilling aims to expand the mineralised footprint.  \n\n*No material capital/financial updates or timetable events.*",
