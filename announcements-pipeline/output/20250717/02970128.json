  "summary": "- **Trial Update**: Recruitment completed for Co-PSMA trial evaluating 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA vs. 68Ga-PSMA-11 in prostate cancer recurrence detection (50 patients, Phase II).  \n- **Catalyst**: Results expected \"in the coming months\"; potential positive readout could support 64Cu-SAR-bisPSMA's superiority over SOC.  \n- **Pipeline Progress**: Phase III trials (CLARIFY and AMPLIFY) ongoing, with St Vincent\u2019s Hospital Sydney recruiting for both.  \n- **Technology Differentiator**: SAR-bisPSMA\u2019s delayed imaging (copper-64 half-life) may improve sensitivity vs. SOC in low-PSA patients.  \n\n*Omitted: Background on prostate cancer stats, boilerplate disclaimers, and director quotes without material updates.*",
