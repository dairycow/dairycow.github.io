  "summary": "**Material Information Summary (Metallurgical Test Results Announcement):**  \n\n- **High-grade copper concentrates with strong recoveries** achieved from multiple mineralized zones at Mumbezhi Project:  \n  - **Kabikupa (fresh composite):** 27.5% Cu, 310 ppm Co, 95.3% Cu recovery (single cleaning stage).  \n  - **Nyungu Central (fresh composite):** 24.6% Cu, 0.9% Co, 96.2% Cu recovery (single cleaning stage).  \n  - **Nyungu Central (transition composite):** 32.1% Cu, 9.1% Co, 81.4% Cu recovery (two cleaning stages).  \n\n- **Gold by-product potential:** Elevated gold (0.40 g/t Au) in Nyungu Central transition material, with concentrate grades up to 29 g/t Au, suggesting future revenue upside.  \n\n- **Cost efficiencies:** Coarse primary grind size (P80 250\u00b5m) reduces projected plant capital/operating costs. Simplified processing confirmed for Nyungu Central and Kabikupa deposits.  \n\n- **Superior results vs. historical benchmarks:** Improved recoveries and concentrate grades compared to prior operator (Argonaut, 2020\u201321).  \n\n- **Next steps:** Ongoing Phase 2 exploration, license-wide gold assessment, and metallurgical/comminution testwork.  \n\n*Note: No capital raising, financials, or material corporate actions disclosed.*",
