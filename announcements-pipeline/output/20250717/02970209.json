  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (ASX: PVT - Exploration Update Announcement)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **Exploration Focus:** Targeting **high-grade Cu-Ni-PGM** deposits in the **Belleterre-Angliers Greenstone Belt (BAGB), Quebec, Canada**, leveraging historical high-grade intercepts and undrilled geophysical anomalies.  \n- **Historical Drill Results (Selective High Grades):**  \n  - **Midrim:** 21.1m @ **2.48% Cu, 1.71% Ni, 2.66 g/t PGM** (individual up to **7.06% Cu, 7.00% Ni, 11.6 g/t PGM**).  \n  - **Alotta:** 25.6m @ **1.82% Cu, 1.37% Ni, 1.68 g/t PGM** (individual up to **23.8% Cu, 10.3 g/t PGM**).  \n  - **LacCroche:** 12.1m @ **1.13% Cu, 0.77% Ni, 1.41 g/t PGM**.  \n- **Untapped Potential:** Multiple **undrilled EM anomalies** identified; only ~10% of the 10km x 15km property explored historically.  \n- **New Exploration Program:**  \n  - **Fieldwork commenced (Q3 2025):** Mapping, sampling, and ground EM surveys.  \n  - **AI-assisted targeting:** Applied to historical data and new geophysical models.  \n  - **\"Drill-ready\" target (VC1):** 175\u2013200m conductor at 25m depth, stronger than known Midrim mineralization.  \n- **Infrastructure Advantage:** Proximity to **Abitibi mining district**, underutilized milling capacity (e.g., Agnico Eagle\u2019s 14Mtpa spare capacity), and low-cost hydropower (~5.5c/kWh).  \n- **Parallel Development:** Ongoing resource expansion at **Horden Lake (37Mt @ 1.1% CuEq)** while advancing BAGB projects.  \n\n#### **Material Impact:**  \n- High-grade intercepts and systematic exploration approach **validate district-scale potential**.  \n- Near-term catalyst: **Drill results expected in Q3 2025**, targeting new discoveries in a tier-1 jurisdiction.  \n\n*Note: Summary excludes operational/logistical details, director statements, and non-material geological descriptions.*",
