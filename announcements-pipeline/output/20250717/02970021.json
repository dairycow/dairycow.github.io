  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary \u2013 Buru Energy ASX Announcement (17 July 2025)**  \n\n#### **Key Updates on Rafael Gas Project:**  \n- **Revised development timeline**:  \n  - Drilling sequence changed \u2013 **Rafael B well to be drilled and tested first**, followed by recompletion of Rafael 1.  \n  - **Drilling now expected June Quarter 2026** (previously planned earlier).  \n  - **Final Investment Decision (FID) delayed to early Q3 2026** (shifted by ~6 months).  \n  - **First production target unchanged \u2013 late 2027**.  \n\n- **Reason for change**:  \n  - Risk mitigation \u2013 Rafael 1 well condition may be compromised; Rafael B expected to provide better flow test results and reserves certification.  \n\n- **Project fundamentals unchanged**:  \n  - Still targeting feedstock supply for **Rafael LNG Project** (partnered with Clean Energy Fuels Australia).  \n  - **Planning for regulatory approvals, traditional owner agreements, and gas marketing ongoing**.  \n\n- **Funding/Partnering**:  \n  - **Upstream partner/funding discussions underway** (data room active).  \n\n**No capital raising, financial, or trading halt details disclosed.**  \n\n**Impact**: Short-term delay in FID but no change to long-term production target. Operational risk reduced by modified drilling sequence. Partnering/funding efforts could influence capital structure.  \n\n*(Omitted: Background details, CEO commentary, historical flow test data, generic project benefits.)*",
