  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:\n- **Resource Upgrade at Orlando Deposit:**  \n  - Indicated Resource classification increased from **42% to 56%** of total Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE), enhancing confidence for the upcoming scoping study.  \n  - Total resource remains unchanged at **5.95Mt** (1.16% Cu, 1.50g/t Au) under a **1.0g/t Au-equivalent cut-off**.  \n\n- **Key Implications:**  \n  - No new drilling conducted; upgrade driven by improved QAQC data validation and statistical analysis of historical assays.  \n  - Supports progression of the **Orlando Scoping Study**, expected to be finalized shortly.  \n\n- **JORC Compliance:**  \n  - Re-release includes required disclosures under Listing Rule 5.8.1 and JORC Clause 50 (metal-equivalent calculations).  \n\n- **Operational Context:**  \n  - Part of CuFe\u2019s **55%-owned Tennant Creek Project** (NT, Australia).  \n  - Historic production (1960s\u20131990s) and robust metallurgical data underpin resource confidence.  \n\n---  \n**Brevity Note:** Excluded routine QAQC/metallurgical details, director quotes, and non-material tables. Focused on actionable capital markets data.",
