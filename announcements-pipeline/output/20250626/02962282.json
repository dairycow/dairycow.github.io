  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (Herberton Project VTEM Survey Results)**  \n\n- **Exploration Results**:  \n  - **Strong EM anomalies** identified at Orient Project, suggesting potential extensions of known silver-indium mineralization.  \n  - New anomalies at **Deadman Creek** (northern extension of Orient System) indicate possible sulphide mineralization.  \n  - Exploration suggests Orient mineral system **larger than previously known**, with both East and West zones open for expansion.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - **Modeling of VTEM anomalies** (prioritizing Orient area) to rank targets for **drill testing** (expected mid-to-late July 2025).  \n  - Fieldwork (mapping/sampling) at Deadman Creek and other anomalies.  \n\n- **Funding**:  \n  - Received **AUD $230,375** from Queensland Government\u2019s Collaborative Exploration Initiative (CEI) for the VTEM survey.  \n\n- **Exploration Target**:  \n  - Orient Project global target: **32\u201342 Mt @ 110\u2013124 g/t Ag Eq.** (80 g/t cutoff).  \n\n**No capital raising, trading halt, or financial adjustments identified.**",
