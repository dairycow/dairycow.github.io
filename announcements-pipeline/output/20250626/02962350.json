  "summary": "### **Exploration Update Summary \u2013 Spartan Resources (ASX: SPR)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **West Winds Deposit (Underground Drilling):**  \n  - High-grade intercepts confirm continuity and extension of mineralization. Notable results:  \n    - **3.94m @ 163.67g/t Au** (hanging wall) and **3m @ 6.86g/t Au** (main zone).  \n    - **6.13m @ 6.32g/t Au** within broader **32.73m @ 1.62g/t Au**.  \n    - **18.36m @ 2.41g/t Au** in main zone.  \n  - Total drilling: **9,063m completed** (28 holes).  \n\n- **Applewood Deposit (Underground Drilling):**  \n  - Confirmed high-grade hanging wall lode continuity from West Winds. Notable assays:  \n    - **18.98m @ 5.56g/t Au** (including **1.96m @ 41.53g/t Au**).  \n    - **1.85m @ 17.74g/t Au** (hanging wall).  \n  - Total drilling: **2,833m completed** (7 holes).  \n\n- **Pepper Deposit (Surface Drilling):**  \n  - Infill drilling validated resource model:  \n    - **22.50m @ 7.71g/t Au** (including **7.25m @ 16.84g/t Au**).  \n\n- **Never Never & Never Never North Prospects:**  \n  - **12.31m @ 21.18g/t Au** (Never Never).  \n  - High-grade shear zones identified at Never Never North:  \n    - **0.3m @ 965g/t Au** and **1.84m @ 19.24g/t Au**.  \n\n- **Hendricks Prospect:**  \n  - Mineralization confirmed at depth:  \n    - **7m @ 2.32g/t Au** within broader **34m @ 0.93g/t Au**.  \n\n#### **Operational Update:**  \n- **H1 CY2025 Surface Drilling Completed:**  \n  - **22,921m** (RC & Diamond) drilled across priority targets.  \n- **Integration Study Progress:** Metallurgical test work ongoing via partnership with **Ramelius Resources**.  \n\n#### **Material Implications:**  \n- Results reinforce **high-grade underground potential** at West Winds and Applewood, supporting future reserve upgrades.  \n As a capital markets analyst, I would flag these intercepts\u2014especially the +100g/t grades\u2014as **highly material** for resource growth and mine planning. Further drilling (infill/extensional) will likely drive re-rating potential.  \n\n**No capital raising or timetable updates identified.** Pure exploration catalyst.  \n\n---  \n**Priority for Traders:** Monitor follow-up drill results and reserve estimates (expected post-Feasibility Study). Liquidity impact hinges on confirmation of mineable widths.",
