  "summary": "- **Takeover Offer Received**: Kinterra Capital made an off-market takeover bid for all New World shares at **A$0.057/share** (slightly below current price of A$0.058).  \n- **Timetable**: Offer opens no earlier than **10 July 2025**, minimum 1-month acceptance period.  \n- **Existing Scheme Agreement**: New World is already bound by a **Scheme Implementation Deed with CAML** (announced 21 May 2025). Kinterra\u2019s bid may qualify as a \"Superior Proposal,\" triggering a **5-business-day matching right** for CAML.  \n- **Board Stance**: Current recommendation remains in favor of CAML scheme. Shareholders advised to **TAKE NO ACTION** pending further guidance.  \n\n**Key Implications**: Potential takeover competition; CAML has right to match/renegotiate. Shares trading near bid price suggests limited arbitrage upside.",
