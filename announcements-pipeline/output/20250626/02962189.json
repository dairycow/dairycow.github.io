Voting rights for lent shares are held by the borrower, with restrictions (requires borrower instructions to vote).  \n- **Final Holdings**: No remaining voting rights disclosed post-cessation.  \n\n**Material Information for Trading/Capital Markets:**  \n- **Significant Sell Activity**: Net reduction in holdings over time, leading to BlackRock\u2019s exit as a substantial holder.  \n- **Liquidity Impact**: Potential increased liquidity due to large-scale disposals (e.g., institutional sell-downs).  \n- **Valuation Signal**: Exit of a major institutional investor may reflect sentiment or portfolio rebalancing.  \n\n**Actionable Points:**  \n- Monitor for further disclosures on substantial holder movements.  \n- Assess market reaction to BlackRock\u2019s exit (volume/price trends).  \n\n**Format Compliance:** Omitted non-material operational/legal details. Focused on trading and capital structure impacts.  \n\n**Conclusion:** No immediate capital raising or corporate action signaled, but noteworthy for institutional ownership tracking.  \n\n---  \n*Note: For full transactional details, refer to Annexure A of the announcement.*",
