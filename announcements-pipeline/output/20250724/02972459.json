Key disclosures (e.g., JORC resources, exploration targets) are already publicly known.  \n\n**If you have a specific ASX announcement to review, please upload the PDF for extraction of material details.**  \n\n*Note: Forward-looking statements, disclaimers, and background project data are routine and not material for immediate trading decisions.*",
