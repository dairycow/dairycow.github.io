  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **New High-Grade Copper-Gold Discoveries at Nelore East Prospect:**  \n  - 11.5m at **2.84% Cu** and **0.90g/t Au** from 91.9m (BON-DD-25-040)  \n  - 6.8m at **1.89% Cu** and **1.08g/t Au** from 107.6m (BON-DD-25-040)  \n  - Mineralization remains **open at depth and along strike**, supported by DHEM surveys.  \n\n- **Expansion of Mineralized Corridor at Nelore West Prospect:**  \n  - Broad intercepts confirm continuity between high-grade breccia pipes:  \n    - 43.4m at **0.32% Cu** from 77.6m (BON-DD-25-036)  \n    - 15.8m at **0.40% Cu** from 91.2m (BON-DD-25-039)  \n\n- **Iron Ore Intersections:**  \n  - 36.1m at **32.48% Fe** (BON-DD-25-039)  \n  - Exploration Target: **520\u2013780Mt at 30\u201335% Fe** (conceptual, JORC-compliant).  \n\n- **Strategic Location:**  \n  - Proximity to infrastructure: **20km from BHP\u2019s Antas Norte copper plant**, 35km from Vale\u2019s concentrate facility.  \n\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Drilling paused for data integration; next phase to focus on **depth extensions** and **high-priority targets**.  \n  - Metallurgical testing underway for copper sulphide samples.  \n\n**Key Takeaway:** Significant grade and scale potential at Boi Novo, with new high-grade hits and broader mineralization reinforcing project viability. No capital-raising or timetable details disclosed.",
