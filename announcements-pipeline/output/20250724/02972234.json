  "summary": "### Material Information Summary (Exploration Results Announcement):  \n\n**1. Discovery of New High-Grade Copper-Gold Zone at Nelore East:**  \n- Intercepts include:  \n  - **11.5m @ 2.84% Cu & 0.90g/t Au** (from 91.9m)  \n  - **6.8m @ 1.89% Cu & 1.08g/t Au** (from 107.6m)  \n- Mineralisation remains **open at depth and along strike** (confirmed by DHEM surveys).  \n- Chalcopyrite-dominant, with IOCG-style potential (similar to Caraj\u00e1s deposits).  \n\n**2. Nelore West Prospect Expansion:**  \n- Broad zones of 0.3\u20130.5% Cu over 40m widths, linking high-grade breccia pipes.  \n- Key intercept: **43.4m @ 0.32% Cu & 0.07g/t Au** (from 77.6m).  \n\n**3. Iron Ore Intersections:**  \n- Additional itabirite iron mineralisation:  \n  - **36.1m @ 32.48% Fe** (from 107.8m).  \n\n**4. Strategic Location:**  \n- Project is **20km from BHP\u2019s Antas Norte copper plant** and 35km from Vale\u2019s concentrate facility.  \n\n**5. Next Steps:**  \n- Drilling paused for data integration; next phase to target depth extensions and new zones.  \n- Metallurgical testing underway (samples sent to SGS Geosol).  \n\n*No capital raising, financials, or material changes to capital structure identified.*",
