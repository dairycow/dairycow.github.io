  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement: Investor Webinar Presentation  \n\n#### **Key Material Information:**  \n- **Strategic Partnership with KBR:**  \n  - Exclusive global deal to accelerate licensing and commercialization of Hazer\u2019s hydrogen technology.  \n  - KBR contributes A$3M to develop large-scale (50,000+ tpa) design packages.  \n  - Exclusivity in ammonia/methanol markets; no competing methane pyrolysis tech marketed by KBR.  \n\n- **Commercial Pipeline:**  \n  - 45+ active global leads; 1.2+ Mtpa potential hydrogen capacity (~1% global market).  \n  - Sectors: Oil & gas majors, ammonia producers, steelmakers, sustainable aviation fuel.  \n  - Japan project advances post pre-feasibility study; UK MOU signed for 20ktpa plant.  \n\n- **Graphite Opportunity:**  \n  - High-purity byproduct with tightening global supply (China dominates 80% of market).  \n  - Target industries: concrete/asphalt, batteries, steelmaking (A$300\u2013700/tonne pricing).  \n  - Potential revenue: ~A$45M/year per 50ktpa H2 project (150ktpa graphite).  \n\n- **Financial Position:**  \n  - A$10.7M capital raised in Q4 FY25; total liquidity >A$16M.  \n  - Reduced operating expenses post-CDP testing; non-dilutive grant funding secured.  \n\n- **Technology Differentiation:**  \n  - Cost parity with steam methane reforming (SMR) at ~US$1/kg H2 (zero emissions, no CCS required).  \n  - Lower energy intensity (8\u201310 kWh/kg) vs. SMR (13 kWh/kg) and electrolysis.  \n\n- **Near-Term Catalysts:**  \n  - License agreements and FEED studies for pipeline projects.  \n  - Graphite offtake partnerships; strategic collaborations (e.g., Mitsui).  \n\n#### **Omitted Details:**  \n- Routine operational updates, director names, legal disclaimers.  \n- Forward-looking statements (not material for trading decisions).  \n\n**Material Impact:** Advances commercial deployment, strengthens IP/licensing model, and leverages graphite demand surge.  \n\n*No material information omitted; summary tailored for capital markets relevance.*",
