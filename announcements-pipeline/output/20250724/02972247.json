  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Drilling Program Commencement**:  \n  - 17,000m combined aircore (AC) and reverse circulation (RC) drilling initiated at the Guyer Trend within the 14 Mile Well Gold Project.  \n  - 4,000m AC program at **Guyer West** (targeting granite margin gold anomaly) underway; results expected **August 2025**.  \n  - 12,700m RC program to follow, testing multiple targets along the Guyer Trend (granite-greenstone contact and Guyer Ridge nugget patch); completion expected **September 2025**.  \n\n- **Funding**: Program fully funded under the **$5M minimum commitment** from the **$35M Farm-In/JV agreement with Gold Road Resources (ASX: GOR)**.  \n\n- **Key Targets**:  \n  - **Guyer Main Anomaly**: 6km gold anomaly along granite-greenstone contact.  \n  - **Guyer Ridge**: RC drilling to assess mafic trend and gold nugget concentration.  \n\n- **Historical Context**: Recent high-grade intercepts (e.g., **6m @ 2.98 g/t Au**) support potential for primary gold system beneath cover.  \n\n*No material financial or capital structure impacts disclosed.*",
