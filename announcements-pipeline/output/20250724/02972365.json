  "summary": "### **Quarterly Report (Appendix 4C) Summary**  \n\n#### **Material Information for Trading/Capital Markets Decisions**  \n- **Exploration Highlights (Stavely Project, Victoria):**  \n  - **Fairview South Gold Prospect:**  \n    - Drill hole **SFSRC001** intersected **40m @ 1.96g/t Au** (including **17m @ 4.18g/t Au** and **1m @ 49.2g/t Au**).  \n    - Gossanous float samples assayed up to **25.60g/t Au**, extending mineralisation 400\u2013600m further south.  \n  - **Fairview North Gold Prospect:**  \n    - Drill results include **59m @ 1.31g/t Au**, **42m @ 1.57g/t Au**, and **29m @ 0.96g/t Au** with high-grade sub-intervals.  \n    - Metallurgical tests show **>80% gold recoverable** via heap leaching; gravity + leach improves recoveries to **85\u201395.3%**.  \n\n- **Corporate & Financial:**  \n  - **Cash balance:** **$1.2M** (as of June 2025).  \n  - **Grant funding:** **$430k** received from WA EIS for Hawkstone Ni-Cu Project drilling and EM survey.  \n\n- **Planned Exploration:**  \n  - **Fairview North/South:** Follow-up RC drilling, soil auger sampling, and extensional aircore programs.  \n  - **S41 Prospect:** IP survey and infill aircore drilling post-harvest (late 2025/early 2026).  \n  - **Hawkstone Project:** Heritage survey ahead of MLEM geophysics (2026).  \n\n#### **Key Takeaways for Investors**  \n1. **High-grade gold intersections** at Fairview South/North underscore potential for scalable, shallow mineralisation.  \n2. **Low-cost heap-leach viability** confirmed by metallurgical tests, enhancing project economics.  \n3. Tight cash position (**$1.2M**) may necessitate near-term funding if exploration accelerates.  \n\n**No material changes to tenements or capital structure identified.**  \n\n---  \n*Note: Omitted operational details (e.g., drilling logistics, conference attendance) as non-material to valuation/trading.*",
