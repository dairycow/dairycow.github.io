  "summary": "### **Summary of ASX Announcement \u2013 Openn Negotiation Ltd (ASX: OPN)**  \n\n#### **Key Points:**  \n- **Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) Executed (17 Jan 2025)**  \n  - DOCA effectuated, exiting external administration.  \n  - Control returned to new directors; new Company Secretary appointed.  \n\n- **Recapitalisation Completed**  \n  - **Capital raising**: Issued **101.626M shares** to raise **A$211k** (placement).  \n  - **Independent Expert\u2019s Report (IER)** deemed the transaction **fair and reasonable** for non-associated shareholders.  \n\n- **Financial Position (Q1 2025 \u2013 Appendix 4C)**  \n  - **Closing cash balance**: **A$164k** (up from A$40k previous quarter).  \n  - **Net operating cash outflow**: **A$(87k)** for the quarter.  \n  - **Estimated funding runway**: **1.89 quarters** (reliant on shareholder loan).  \n\n- **Post-Quarter Funding**  \n  - **A$74,959.74 interest-free loan** from major shareholder (ST Holding 2 Pty Ltd), due 31 Dec 2025.  \n\n- **Operational Update**  \n  - **No substantive business activities** during the quarter (as per ASX Listing Rule 4.7C.1).  \n  - **No related-party payments** reported.  \n\n#### **Conclusion**:  \nThe company remains in a fragile financial state post-administration, with minimal operational activity and reliance on shareholder support. The recapitalisation provides short-term liquidity but raises concerns over dilution and ongoing viability.  \n\n**Priority for traders/investors**: Monitor follow-on funding and operational revival efforts.",
