  "summary": "Here is the concise summary of material information from the Virgin Australia Holdings Limited Employee Incentive Scheme announcement:\n\n### **Employee Incentive Scheme Key Points**  \n1. **Purpose**  \n   - Designed to reward, retain, and motivate employees by aligning their interests with shareholders via equity awards (Shares, Share Rights, Options, or Performance Rights).  \n\n2. **Award Types & Conditions**  \n   - **Shares**: Subject to vesting conditions (e.g., forfeiture if employment terminates or performance hurdles fail).  \n   - **Options/Performance Rights/Share Rights**: Exerciseable only after vesting conditions are met (e.g., service period, performance metrics).  \n\n3. **Key Dates**  \n   - **Vesting Dates**: Determined by the Board; tied to satisfaction of conditions (e.g., employment duration, performance).  \n   - **Exercise Period**: Typically up to 7 years from grant (unless specified otherwise).  \n\n4. **Forfeiture Triggers**  \n   - Awards lapse if:  \n     - Employment terminates (varies by leaver type: *Bad Leaver* = immediate forfeiture; *Good Leaver* = pro-rata retention).  \n     - Vesting conditions unmet.  \n     - Participant breaches rules (e.g., unauthorized trading, misconduct).  \n\n5. **Change of Control**  \n   - Board may accelerate vesting or waive conditions upon a takeover/merger.  \n\n6. **Clawback & Malus Provisions**  \n   - Awards may be forfeited or adjusted for financial misstatements or employee misconduct.  \n\n7. **Trading Restrictions**  \n   - Participants prohibited from hedging unvested awards.  \n   - Share transfers restricted until vesting conditions are satisfied.  \n\n### **No Material Trading or Capital Markets Impact Identified**  \n- No new capital raising, issuance, or liquidity events announced.  \n- Document outlines internal employee incentive mechanics only.  \n\n**Note**: Omitted operational/legal boilerplate. Focused on clauses affecting equity structure, employee incentives, and potential dilution risks.",
