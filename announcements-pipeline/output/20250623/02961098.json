  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement: **INOVIQ Limited \u2013 Response to ASX Queries**  \n\n#### **Key Material Information**:  \n- **Study Results**:  \n  - **CAR-NK-EVs (exosomes)** demonstrated **88% cell death** in **triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)** and **non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells** within 96 hours in **in vitro lab tests**.  \n  - Results were statistically significant (*p < 0.05*) with **3 biological replicates** and **3 technical replicates per group**.  \n  - **Control groups**: Untreated cells, PBS, and HEK-293-derived EVs (TNBC only).  \n\n- **Forward-Looking Claims**:  \n  - Potential for **\"off-the-shelf\" therapy** (vs. personalized CAR-T).  \n  - Hypothesized advantages: **faster production**, **safer use** (reduced immune rejection risk), and **higher efficacy** in solid tumors (due to exosome penetration).  \n\n- **ASX Compliance**:  \n  - Company asserts the **announcement header** (\"New treatment kills 88%...\") was fair, noting it included **\"in lab tests\"** for context.  \n  - Confirms **Listing Rule 3.1 compliance** and board-approved response.  \n\n- **Clarifications**:  \n  - Studies conducted **in-house** (not by Peter MacCallum as previously disclosed).  \n  - No omission of material details; ASX queries addressed technical study design (e.g., control groups, statistical methods).  \n\n#### **Trading Implications**:  \n- **Positive preclinical data** may impact sentiment, but **early-stage nature** (in vitro only) warrants caution.  \n- **No capital or operational updates** (e.g., funding, clinical timelines) disclosed.  \n\n**Format Note**: Excluded legal/technical rebuttals, director names, and redundant details.",
