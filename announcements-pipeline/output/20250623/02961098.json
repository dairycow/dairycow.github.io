  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement:  \n\n1. **Key Findings**  \n   - INOVIQ\u2019s CAR-NK-EV therapy achieved **88% cell death** in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines in **in vitro lab tests** (statistically significant, *p < 0.05*).  \n   - Results based on **three independent experiments** with three technical replicates each.  \n\n2. **Forward-Looking Statements**  \n   - Potential advantages of CAR-NK-EVs over current CAR-T therapies:  \n     - **\u201cOff-the-shelf\u201d** (allogeneic) production vs. patient-specific CAR-T.  \n     - Potential for **faster production, improved safety**, and **enhanced efficacy** in solid tumors (cited scientific literature).  \n\n3. **Regulatory Context**  \n   - Study design (treatment vs. control) aligns with **FDA/OECD guidelines** for in vitro research.  \n   - No in vivo or clinical data disclosed; early-stage research only.  \n\n4. **Clarifications**  \n   - Header (\u201cNew treatment kills 88% of Breast and Lung Cancer Cells\u201d) deemed fair by IIQ, noting **\u201cin lab tests\u201d** qualifier.  \n   - Confirms no omission of material data; controls included untreated cells and PBS.  \n\n**No material trading/capital markets actions identified** (e.g., no capital raising, halt request, or financials). Focus is on preclinical results and regulatory compliance.  \n\n*Note: Excluded boilerplate, director names, and non-material methodological details.*",
