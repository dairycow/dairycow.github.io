  "summary": "### **Summary of Material Information**  \n\n#### **Takeover Offer Update**  \n\u2b29 **Betr's Potential Offer ($1.05\u2013$1.14 per share, all-scrip)** vs. **MIXI's Offer ($1.20 cash)**  \n- Betr\u2019s offer lower than MIXI's, highly conditional (regulatory/Betr shareholder approvals required).  \n- No liquidity/cash certainty due to Betr's low ASX trading volume.  \n- PointsBet Board unanimously recommends **MIXI Scheme** (vote on **25 June 2025**).  \n\n#### **Key Risks with Betr\u2019s Proposal**  \n- **Revenue dis-synergies likely** (65% customer overlap with PointsBet; historical declines post-merger).  \n- **Synergy claims overstated** (Betr\u2019s analysis disputed by PointsBet\u2019s industry experts).  \n- **PSR dilution risk**: 5.1m employee awards vesting 1 July 2025; Betr may roll them into new awards.  \n\n#### **MIXI Scheme Proxy Vote Status**  \n- **Early proxy tally**: ~90% support (excluding Betr\u2019s 19.9% stake); final results before 25 June vote.  \n\n#### **No Superior Proposal Currently**  \n- Only **MIXI Scheme** actionable; if rejected, **MIXI Takeover Offer ($1.20 cash)** follows.  \n\n---  \n**Conclusion**: MIXI\u2019s cash offer remains superior pending final shareholder vote. Betr\u2019s proposal carries execution/liquidity risks.",
