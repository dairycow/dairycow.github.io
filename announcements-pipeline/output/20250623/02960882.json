  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary \u2013 Trigg Minerals Ltd (ASX: TMG)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **Antimony Canyon Project (ACP) Expansion**:  \n  - Confirmed antimony mineralisation extends **10km north** to **Dry Wash Canyon**, significantly expanding the project footprint.  \n  - Mineralisation now proven **throughout the vertical profile** of the Flagstaff Formation, indicating potential for a larger resource.  \n  - **250+ samples** sent to labs from ACP and Dry Wash Canyon; assays pending.  \n\n- **Strategic Positioning**:  \n  - ACP is one of the **largest high-grade undeveloped antimony projects in the USA**, with a foreign resource estimate of **12.7Mt @ 0.79% Sb** (100,000+ tonnes contained Sb).  \n  - No domestic antimony production in the US; ACP addresses **national supply chain resilience**.  \n\n- **Near-Term Pilot Mining**:  \n  - Plans for **pilot-scale mining** to support metallurgical testing and feasibility studies.  \n  - Targeting **surface material** (waste dumps, outcrops) for low-cost evaluation.  \n\n- **Capital Markets Implications**:  \n  - Received **strategic inbound interest** for feedstock offtake and potential **NASDAQ/NYSE uplisting**.  \n  - Landholding expanded to secure interpreted mineralised corridors.  \n\n- **Exploration Upside**:  \n  - **30+ historical mines/adits** identified, with mineralisation **not closed off**.  \n  - New North-South structural controls suggest potential for a **larger mineralised system**.  \n\n#### **Next Steps:**  \n- Assay results expected in **~6 weeks**.  \n- Work underway to convert foreign resource to **JORC/SK-1300-compliant estimate**.  \n\n*No material financial figures or capital-raising details disclosed.*",
