  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **1. San Juan Project Update**  \n- Mineral exploration licenses expected to be granted **on or before 29 August 2025**.  \n- Post-grant, planned exploration includes geochemical sampling, geological mapping, and geophysical surveys.  \n\n#### **2. Vetas Project Status**  \n- Maiden drilling campaign delayed due to **socio-political instability** in Colombia since 2022.  \n- Mining obligations **suspended until August 2025** (request pending ANM approval).  \n- Company retains legal ownership and access rights but cannot operate safely yet.  \n\n#### **3. Recent Project Disposals**  \n- **Santa Rosa Gold Project** relinquished (Nov 2023) after assays showed **low gold prospectivity** ($37k spent).  \n- **Northern section of Hornby Lake Lithium Project** relinquished (Feb 2024) due to **no economic lithium mineralisation**; renewal application pending for remaining claims.  \n\n#### **4. Capital & Expenditure**  \n- **Total exploration spend (2 years): $418k** vs. IPO commitment of $2.93M (12.4% spent).  \n- **November 2024 capital raising**: $461,500 (before costs) for San Juan exploration.  \n- **Cash balance (March 2025): $3.39M**.  \n\n#### **5. ASX Compliance Risks**  \n- ASX queries adequacy of operations for continued listing (Listing Rule 12.1).  \n- Company asserts sufficient structure but acknowledges exploration delays.  \n\n#### **6. Key Upcoming Catalyst**  \n- **San Juan license grant by 29 Aug 2025** \u2013 critical for exploration commencement.  \n\n**Conclusion**: Operational execution hinges on San Juan license approval and Colombia stability. Low exploration spend vs. IPO commitments remains a compliance concern.  \n\n*No material information omitted; prioritizes trading/capital impact.*",
