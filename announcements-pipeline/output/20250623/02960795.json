  "summary": "**Key Material Information:**  \n\n- **Drill Results:** Multiple high-grade scandium intercepts confirmed, including:  \n  - 11m @ 357 ppm Sc (548ppm Sc Oxide) from 16m (FI2797)  \n  - 26m @ 344 ppm Sc (528ppm Sc Oxide) from 9m (FI2792)  \n  - 9m @ 386 ppm Sc (592ppm Sc Oxide) from 17m (FI2795)  \n\n- **Resource Estimate Timeline:** Scandium mineral resource estimate expected by **August 2025** (delayed from June 2025 due to lab delays, weather). Remaining assay results due **late July 2025**.  \n\n- **Strategic Context:** Chinese export restrictions on scandium (67% of global supply) heighten strategic demand for non-Chinese sources like Rimfire\u2019s Fifield District projects.  \n\n- **Exploration Focus:** Results support advancement to resource estimation, initially targeting a 400x300m \"Southern Zone\" with potential for additional high-grade zones along strike.  \n\n**Excluded**: Non-material operational details, JORC boilerplate, director commentary, and historical comparisons.",
