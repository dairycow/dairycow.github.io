  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (Trigg Minerals Ltd - ASX:TMG)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n1. **Antimony Expansion & Strategic Positioning**  \n   - Confirmed **extension of antimony mineralisation** beyond historically defined limits at **Antimony Canyon Project (ACP), Utah** (10km north to **Dry Wash Canyon**).  \n   - Mineralisation linked by **newly identified North-South trending structures**, suggesting a larger mineralised corridor.  \n   - **Strategic land expansion** staked to consolidate control over extensions.  \n\n2. **Near-Term Pilot Mining Initiative**  \n   - Plans for **pilot-scale mining** at ACP to support metallurgical testing and feasibility studies.  \n   - Material sourced from **surface waste dumps** and historically sampled areas (no JORC-compliant Reserve yet).  \n   - Processing via **on-site crushing and gravity separation**; unrecovered antimony stockpiled for future flotation.  \n\n3. **Exploration & Resource Potential**  \n   - **250 samples** collected (ACP + Dry Wash Canyon) \u2013 assays pending (expected late July 2025).  \n   - Field mapping confirms **vertical continuity** of antimony in the Flagstaff Formation, expanding prospective stratigraphy.  \n   - Target: **Convert USBM foreign resource** (12.7Mt at 0.79% Sb) to JORC/SK-1300 compliance.  \n\n4. **Market & Strategic Interest**  \n   - Received **inbound interest** for long-term feedstock deals and potential **NASDAQ/NYSE uplisting**.  \n   - ACP is one of the **largest undeveloped antimony projects in the US** (critical for supply chain resilience).  \n\n#### **Next Steps:**  \n   - Assay results (late July 2025) to guide further exploration.  \n   - Feasibility studies for pilot mining.  \n\n**No material fundraising, operational disruptions, or financial data disclosed.**  \n\n---  \n*Summary excludes non-material details (e.g., director quotes, procedural JORC tables).*",
