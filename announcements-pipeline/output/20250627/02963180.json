  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n**Announcement Type:** Exploration Update / Mineralisation Extension  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **Strategic Significance:**  \n  - Antimony Canyon Project (ACP) in Utah is positioned to address urgent U.S. demand for domestic antimony (currently no U.S. production).  \n  - Received inbound strategic interest due to global tensions, including proposals for NASDAQ/NYSE uplisting.  \n\n- **Mineralisation Expansion:**  \n  - Confirmed antimony mineralisation **10km north** of ACP at **Dry Wash Canyon**, indicating a broader North-South structural corridor.  \n  - Mineralisation extends vertically throughout the **Flagstaff Formation**, increasing potential scale.  \n  - Over **250 samples** collected from ACP and Dry Wash Canyon; assays pending (expected late July 2025).  \n\n- **Pilot-Scale Mining Initiative:**  \n  - Plans for **low-cost, surface-based pilot mining** to support metallurgical testing and feasibility studies.  \n  - Material sourced from historical USBM/UGS data; **no JORC-compliant reserve** yet.  \n\n- **Resource Potential:**  \n  - ACP hosts a **foreign resource estimate** of 12.7Mt at 0.79% Sb (100,000t contained Sb).  \n  - Trigg aims to convert this to JORC/SK-1300 compliance.  \n\n- **Operational Notes:**  \n  - Samples submitted for assay; results to guide further exploration.  \n  - Landholding expanded to secure interpreted mineralised extensions.  \n\n**Omitted:** Non-material details (e.g., historical town names, sample coordinates, routine fieldwork descriptions).  \n\n**Impact:** Confirms exploration upside and near-term development pathway, potentially enhancing valuation and strategic positioning.",
