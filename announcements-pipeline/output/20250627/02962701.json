  "summary": "- **Acquisition Closure**: Rapid Critical Metals has completed the 100% acquisition of the Prophet River Gallium-Germanium Project in British Columbia (2,110 Ha).  \n- **Historic Results**: Previous bulk samples reported high-grade mineralization (up to 22.69% Zn, 40 g/t Ga, 1,500 ppm Ge, 0.36% Pb), highlighting strategic potential.  \n- **Upcoming Exploration**: Planned geologic mapping and sampling (late July 2025), delayed due to wildfires. IP geophysical survey approved to aid drill target identification.  \n- **Strategic Significance**: Ga and Ge are critical metals (banned for export by China), with applications in tech/semiconductors; project positioned as a high-value asset.  \n\n*No capital raising, trading halt, or financial data disclosed.*",
