  "summary": "### Summary of Material Information (ASX: GRL)  \n\n**Announcement Type:** Exploration Update (Lewis Ponds Project)  \n\n- **MRE Expansion Potential**:  \n  - Reprocessed DHEM data identifies **six off-hole conductor plates** outside current Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE), suggesting undiscovered mineralisation.  \n  - Conductors align with sulphide mineralisation in existing MRE, supporting potential for new lenses.  \n\n- **Existing JORC Resource**:  \n  - **6.20 Mt** at **2.0g/t Au, 80g/t Ag, 2.7% Zn, 1.6% Pb, 0.2% Cu** (398k oz Au, 15.9M oz Ag contained metal).  \n\n- **Upcoming Catalysts**:  \n  - **New MRE due July 2025**, incorporating recent drilling and geophysical data.  \n  - **Deep IP survey scheduled for July 2025** to refine drill targets.  \n\n- **Key Targets Identified**:  \n  - **Northern Footwall (16\u201350S conductors)**: Untested lenses 80\u2013480m below surface, up to 200m west of existing resource.  \n  - **Tom\u2019s Zone Deep (150S conductor)**: Large down-dip extension (200m x 200m) at 900m depth.  \n  - **Southern Extension (25\u2013100S conductors)**: Potential resource expansion south of current MRE boundary.  \n\n**Material Impact**: Results highlight **high-grade exploration upside**, with DHEM anomalies providing priority drill targets for resource growth. Near-term MRE update and IP survey may catalyse re-rating.  \n\n*No capital raising, trading halt, or financial data disclosed.*  \n\n---  \n**Note**: Excluded operational/metallurgical details (non-immediate trading impact). Focused on near-term catalysts and exploration upside.",
