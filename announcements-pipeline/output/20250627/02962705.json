  "summary": "### Key Material Information:  \n\n- **High-Grade Scandium Assays**:  \n  - 125-hole RC drilling campaign (3,589m) completed, with 49 holes assayed so far.  \n  - Significant high-grade scandium intersections (cut-off \u2265600ppm Sc):  \n    - 7m @ 884ppm (including 3m @ 1,123ppm)  \n    - 6m @ 788ppm  \n    - 13m @ 743ppm  \n    - Others: 4\u20137m intervals grading 656\u2013714ppm Sc.  \n\n- **Mineral Resource Update**:  \n  - Pending assay results will be incorporated into an updated **Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE)** to support the Syerston Scandium Project Feasibility Study.  \n  - Aim to convert **Inferred Resources** to **Measured/Indicated** categories.  \n\n- **Market Context**:  \n  - Scandium market remains tight due to **China\u2019s export restrictions** (April 2025).  \n  - Ongoing customer discussions in advanced alloy and semiconductor industries.  \n\n- **Drilling Focus**:  \n  - Targeted expansion of high-grade zones, open in multiple directions.  \n  - Confirmed boundary of mineralisation in northwest area; no further drilling planned there.  \n\n*Format: Brevity-focused, excluding operational/technical minutiae unless materially consequential (e.g., assay methods, JORC compliance).*",
