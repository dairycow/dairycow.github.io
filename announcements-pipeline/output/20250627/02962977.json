  "summary": "- **Panel Application**: Nicholas Bolton has submitted an application to the Takeovers Panel regarding Keybridge Capital (ASX: KBC), contesting governance and conflict-of-interest concerns tied to WAM Active-backed directors.  \n- **Takeover Bid Condition**: Yowie\u2019s off-market bid for Keybridge (1:1 share swap) could be voided if Yowie\u2019s board composition changes, which Keybridge is attempting via a shareholder meeting.  \n- **Control Loan Conflict**: Keybridge\u2019s WAM-linked directors face allegations of insider conflict, as their actions (e.g., pushing Yowie board changes) may block the takeover and deny minority shareholders liquidity.  \n- **Interim Orders Denied**: Panel President rejected urgent interim orders to halt Keybridge\u2019s voting at Yowie\u2019s meeting, citing delayed application and potential prejudice to Keybridge as Yowie\u2019s major shareholder.  \n- **Final Orders Sought**: Applicant demands exclusion of WAM nominees from bid decisions, appointment of independent Keybridge directors, and an independent board committee.  \n\n*No capital raising, financials, or trading halt details identified.*",
