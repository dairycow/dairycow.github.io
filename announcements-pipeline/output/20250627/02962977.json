  "summary": "- **Takeover Panel Application**: Mr. Nicholas Bolton applied to the Panel regarding Keybridge Capital Limited (KBC), alleging governance conflicts related to WAM Active Limited's influence over Keybridge\u2019s board during Yowie\u2019s takeover bid.  \n- **Yowie\u2019s Takeover Offer**: 1 Yowie share per KBC share, contingent on no change to Yowie\u2019s board composition (threatened by Keybridge\u2019s s249F meeting to replace Yowie directors).  \n- **Conflict Allegations**: Keybridge\u2019s WAM-linked directors accused of acting as \"participating insiders,\" potentially frustrating Yowie\u2019s bid and denying minority shareholders liquidity.  \n- **Interim Orders Denied**: Panel President declined urgent interim orders to block Keybridge\u2019s votes at Yowie\u2019s meeting, citing late application and potential prejudice to Keybridge as Yowie\u2019s major shareholder.  \n- **Final Orders Sought**: Independent Keybridge directors, exclusion of WAM nominees from bid decisions, and governance protocols per Guidance Note 19.  \n\n**Material Impact**: Potential disruption to Yowie\u2019s takeover bid and Keybridge\u2019s capital structure due to governance disputes and lender influence (WAM).
