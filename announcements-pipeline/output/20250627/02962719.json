  "summary": "Here\u2019s the extracted material information relevant for trading or capital markets decisions, formatted as concise bullet points:\n\n### **Material Takeaways from Quantum Graphite Limited (QGL) Investor Presentation**  \n\n#### **Strategic Supply Chain & Offtake Agreement**  \n- **50+ Year Supply Commitment**: QGL to supply **100,000 tpa flake graphite ore** to Sunlands Pure\u2019s concentrator (South Australia), with exploration plans to extend beyond 50 years.  \n- **Uley Mines Expansion**:  \n  - Near-term (30\u201350 years): Focus on Uley Mines 2\u20136; permitting and drilling underway (drilling crews mobilising Q1 2025).  \n  - District Mines (long-term): Potential **25M tonnes graphite resources**, 6\u00d7 larger than Uley Mines.  \n- **Binding Offtake Agreement**: **55,000 tpa HPG (55% of production)** contracted to MRI Trading AG (5-year term from Dec 2026), targeting Mitsubishi, Marubeni, and Sumitomo.  \n\n#### **US-Centric Market Opportunity**  \n- **US Demand Growth**: Fastmarkets forecasts **700,000 tpa refined graphite demand** in US by 2030 (600% increase); QGL/SP positioned as sole ex-China scalable supplier.  \n- **Pricing Upside**: Macquarie/Fastmarkets project **$9,555/t for Active Anode Material by 2030** (vs. $7,576/t in 2022).  \n\n#### **Project Timelines & Production**  \n- **Concentrator**: 100,000 tpa capacity; initial production target **December 2026**.  \n- **Refinery**: High-purity graphite (HPG) output (99.9% purity) for LFP batteries, thermal storage, and refractory markets.  \n- **JORC Resource**: **7.2Mt @ 10.5% TGC** (Uley Mines), with **4Mt proven reserves**.  \n\n#### **Global Context**  \n- **China Dominance**: Supplies **93% of global refined graphite**; US/EU face **70% cost disadvantage** if prices spike 5\u00d7.  \n- **Policy Tailwinds**: US EXIM Bank\u2019s **Supply Chain Initiative (SCRI)** and tariffs on Chinese anode material (**712% subsidy rate**) support ex-China supply chains.  \n\n#### **Key Dates**  \n- **Resource Update**: Certified reserves/reserves update expected **Q1 2025**.  \n- **Drilling Mobilisation**: District Mines drilling from **Q2 2025**.  \n\n### **Capital Implications**  \n- **Scalability**: District Mines potential (25Mt) could dominate US graphite supply.  \n- **Valuation Leverage**: Exposure to US anode precursor demand and pricing premiums.  \n\n**Omitted**: Non-material operational details, historical background, ESG boilerplate.  \n\n**Summary**: Execution-dependent play on US graphite supply chain diversification, backed offtake and scalable reserves. Monitor Q1 2025 resource update and 2026 production start.",
