  "summary": "Here is the concise extraction of material information from the ASX announcement:\n\n### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n1. **Assay Results \u2013 Mavis Lake Lithium Project**  \n   - High-grade lithium intercepts **outside** current 8Mt @ 1.07% Li\u2082O resource:  \n     - **14.6m @ 1.83% Li\u2082O** (MF24-267)  \n     - **11.7m @ 1.28% Li\u2082O** (MF24-268)  \n     - **9.15m @ 1.21% Li\u2082O** (MF24-269)  \n     - **8.9m @ 1.17% Li\u2082O** (MF24-270)  \n   - **Tot Prospect Expansion**:  \n     - **3.5m @ 1.75% Li\u2082O** (TL24-028)  \n     - **5.9m @ 0.72% Li\u2082O** (TL24-026)  \n\n2. **Resource Growth Potential**  \n   - Mineralisation extends beyond current resource model at **Mavis Lake Main Zone** and **Tot Prospect** (open at depth and along strike).  \n   - **30,637m of drilling** (23,104m at Main Zone, 7,533m at Tot) pending inclusion in updated MRE.  \n\n3. **Capital & Corporate Updates**  \n   - **Completed second tranche of $1.1M placement** at $0.004/share.  \n   - **Finalized acquisition** of Amoco Antimony-Gold project (EL9293, NSW) via issuing **30.9M shares at $0.0081/share**.  \n\n4. **Strategic Positioning**  \n   - Mavis Lake flagged as a **key North American lithium asset**, focusing on low-cost technical work pending market recovery.  \n\n### **Key Implications**  \n- **Resource expansion likely** given high-grade intercepts beyond current boundaries.  \n- **Funding secured** via placement and asset acquisition dilution.  \n\n*No other material trading or liquidity-impacting details identified.*",
