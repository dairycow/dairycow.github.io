Below is a concise summary of the material trading and capital markets information:  \n\n### **Key Product Features**  \n- **Product Type**: Instalment MINIs (Leveraged derivative securities)  \n- **Current Interest Rate**: **8.30% p.a.** (Effective from 17-Jun-25)  \n- **Dividend Treatment**: Typically paid to investor (some codes pay down loan).  \n- **Gearing Levels**: Typically ranges from **20\u201380%** (varies per underlying stock/ETF).  \n- **Stop Loss Trigger**: If the underlying share price falls to the Stop Loss Trigger Level, the MINI may be terminated early.  \n\n### **Example Terms (Selected Highlights)**  \n| MINI Code | Underlying Stock | Loan Amount (AUD) | Stop Loss Level (AUD) | Current Share Price (AUD) | Gearing (%) | Expiry Date | Indicative Div Yield (%) |\n|-----------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| **A2MJOB** | A2 Milk Co Ltd | $4.04 | $7.95 | $7.95 | 42.51% | 26/05/2026 | 1.70% |\n| **ANZJOA** | ANZ Group | $15.25 | $29.60 | $29.60 | 46.14% | 15/07/2032 | 10.41% |\n| **BHPJOA** | BHP Group | $28.74 | $37.44 | $37.44 | 66.98% | 21/01/2032 | 15.19% |\n| **WBCJOA** | Westpac | $26.22 | $33.19 | $33.19 | 70.76% | 15/07/2032 | 15.66% |\n| **CSLJOF** | CSL Ltd | $228.67 | $239.10 | $239.10 | 83.45% | 26/05/2026 | 10.65% |\n\n### **Material Risks**  \n- **Leverage Risk**: High gearing amplifies gains and losses.  \n- **Stop Loss Triggers**: Positions may be forcibly closed if the Stop Loss is hit.  \n- **Expiry Dates**: Most MINIs expire **2026\u20132035**, requiring repayment of the loan.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThis is an indicative list for leveraged investment products tied to ASX-listed securities. Investors should assess:  \n- **Gearing levels** (higher = more risk)  \n- **Proximity to Stop Loss Trigger** (higher % buffer = lower risk)  \n- **Dividend impact** (some MINIs pay dividends, others reduce loan balance).  \n\nNo **issuance or capital raising details**\u2014this is a secondary market product summary.  \n\n**Action**: Investors should compare individual MINIs based on gearing, yield, and downside protection before trading.  \n\n(Note: Full due diligence on each MINI is recommended.)",
