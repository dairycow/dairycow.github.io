  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:\n\n- **High-grade intercept**:  \n  - **MDD420**: 10.0m @ 9.8g/t Au from 200m (true width: 9.3m), demonstrating expanded underground mining potential west of the current high-grade core.  \n\n- **Near-surface, low-grade mineralization confirmed**:  \n  - **MDD432**: 8.3m @ 2.4g/t Au from 27.7m (true width: 7.3m), supporting early, low-strip mining potential.  \n\n- **Stacked low-grade intercepts**:  \n  - **MDD436**: 19m @ 1.7g/t Au from 102.0m (true width: 17.1m), indicating continuity and potential for stacked repeats.  \n\n- **Drilling halted**: RAS South infill drilling paused for updated resource modelling; focus shifts to down-plunge extensional drilling and higher-grade core upgrades.  \n- **Extensional drilling planned**: Targets areas outside current RAS boundaries.  \n\nNo capital raising, financial data, or timetable impacts identified.",
