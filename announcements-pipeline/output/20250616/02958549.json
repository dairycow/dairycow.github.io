  "summary": "### Key Information from ASX Announcement:  \n\n- **High-Grade Intercept**:  \n  - **MDD420**: 10.0m @ **9.8 g/t Au** from 200m depth (true width: 9.3m), extending high-grade potential west of the current core.  \n\n- **Shallow, Low-Strip Mining Potential**:  \n  - **MDD432**: 8.3m @ **2.4 g/t Au** from 27.7m (true width: 7.3m), supporting near-surface, low-strip mining options.  \n\n- **Resource Continuity**:  \n  - **MDD436**: 19m @ **1.7 g/t Au** from 102.0m (true width: 17.1m), confirming stacked low-grade mineralization.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Drilling paused in **RAS South** for updated resource modeling.  \n  - Ongoing infill drilling at **RAS high-grade core** and satellite targets (**SRX**, **CIT**) to upgrade Inferred \u2192 Indicated resources.  \n\n**No capital raising, operational disruptions, or material financial data disclosed.**  \n\n---  \n*Note: Routine drilling results excluded. Focused on intercepts with potential to impact resource estimates or mine planning.*",
