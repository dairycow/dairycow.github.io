  "summary": "- **Substantial Holder Disclosure**:  \n  - **Entities Involved**: 5382917 Limited (SPV) and BGH Capital Group (BGH Fund & Manager).  \n  - **Security**: Ordinary shares in Tourism Holdings Limited (NZX: THL).  \n  - **Movement**:  \n    - SPV/BGH increased holding from **17.795%** (39,345,432 shares) to **19.990%** (44,197,503 shares).  \n  - **Triggering Transaction**:  \n    - On-market purchase of **4,852,071 shares** from Wilson Asset Management (WAM) at **NZ$2.25/share** (total **NZ$10.92M**) on 16 June 2025.  \n    - Includes a contingent **\"top-up\" payment** if SPV/BGH launches a Scheme/ Takeover Offer (>NZ$2.25/share) within 12 months.  \n\n---  \n**Key Implications**:  \n- Potential M&A signal: **19.99% stake** near NZ takeover code's 20% control threshold.  \n- Contingent payout structure suggests **strategic intent** (possible future bid).  \n\n*Omitted*: Legal boilerplate, director names, non-material transaction mechanics.  \n\n*Note*: NZX disclosure (not ASX), but materially relevant for THL trading.",
