  "summary": "- **Material Information Disclosed**:  \n  - WGR executed a **binding toll milling agreement** with Wiluna Mining Corporation for the Gold Duke Project (announced post-market close on 13 June 2025).  \n  - Prior **advanced discussions** were incomplete until agreement finalisation, triggering ASX price query due to trading activity (10 June 2025).  \n\n- **Compliance**: Confirmed reliance on **Listing Rule 3.1A** for delayed disclosure during negotiations.  \n\n*Context*: Response clarifies price/volume volatility linked to undisclosed negotiations, now resolved. No capital or operational impacts beyond the agreement.  \n\n**Format**: Concise bullets targeting material event (agreement execution) and regulatory context. Omitted query mechanics/boilerplate.",
