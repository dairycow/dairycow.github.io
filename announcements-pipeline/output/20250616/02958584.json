  "summary": "### **Exploration Update Summary (DTR \u2013 Dateline Resources Limited)**  \n**Key Material Highlights:**  \n- **Geochemical sampling program (~1,207 samples)** underway at Colosseum Gold-REE Project; initial results expected by **early July 2025**, full interpretation pending.  \n- **Magnetotelluric (MT) survey mobilising** (deep subsurface imaging); progress update expected soon.  \n- **Potential ground-based magnetic survey** under consideration to complement existing datasets (gravity, MT, geochemistry).  \n- **Maiden REE-focused drilling program** in planning; targets to be informed by ongoing exploration results.  \n\n**Context:**  \n- Projects **27.1Mt @ 1.26g/t Au (1.1Moz Au)** JORC Resource (67% Measured & Indicated).  \n- Strategic **REE potential** noted due to proximity to Mountain Pass mine (10km south).  \n\n**No material capital or trading impacts identified.**  \n\n*(Note: Excluded operational/financial details from prior announcements to avoid redundancy per instructions.)*",
