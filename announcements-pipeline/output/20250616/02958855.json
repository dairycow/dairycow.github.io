  "summary": "This document appears to be a product disclosure for CitiFirst MINIs (leveraged derivatives) across various asset classes. Since it is not a typical ASX announcement (e.g., trading halt, capital raising, or financial report), but rather a derivatives product catalog, here\u2019s the material information extracted:\n\n### Key Takeaways for Trading/Capital Markets:\n**Product Type**:  \n- Single Stock MINIs (Long/Short leveraged instruments)  \n- Australian/International Index MINIs  \n- Currency MINIs (AUD crosses)  \n- Commodities MINIs (Gold, Silver, Copper, WTI Crude)  \n\n**Critical Features**:  \n- **Effective Date**: 17-Jun-25  \n- **Leverage**: Gearing ratios range from 5.29% to 98.08% (e.g., BHPKOB at 85.12%, XROKOD at 34.42%)  \n- **Stop Loss Triggers**: Listed for each MINI (e.g., FMGKOD stops at $13.11 vs. current $15.72)  \n- **Variable Interest Rates**:  \n  - MINI Longs: 8.45% p.a.  \n  - MINI Shorts: -0.15% p.a.  \n  - Index/Commodity MINIs: 4.85% p.a.  \n\n**Risk Metrics**:  \n- **Approx % from Stop Loss**: Highlights proximity to stop levels (e.g., FMGKOD at 16.60%, PMEKOA at 73.22%)  \n\n**Material Underlyings**:  \n- Top ASX stocks (e.g., BHP, CBA, CSL), major indices (S&P 500, Nikkei 225), and commodities (Gold, WTI Crude).  \n\n### Actionable Points:  \n- High leverage in single-stock MINIs (e.g., CBAKOB at 88.56%, TLSKOB at 82.38%) may amplify volatility.  \n- Currency MINIs (e.g., AUD/USD, AUD/JPY) show tight stop levels (FXUKOB stops at 0.6400 vs. spot 0.6498).  \n- Commodity MINIs (e.g., Gold at 72.19% gearing) could be sensitive to Fed policy shifts.  \n\n**No Material Corporate Actions Identified** (e.g., no capital raisings, dividends, or operational updates).  \n\n*Note: This summary focuses on instrument specifications relevant for trading decisions. Brokerage implications (e.g., margin calls) should be considered given the leveraged nature of MINIs.*",
