  "summary": "### Key Material Information:\n- **Substantial Holder**: Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Company Limited (Soul Patts)  \n- **Change in Voting Power**:  \n  - **Previous (15/08/2024)**: Total votes = 1,922,854 (7.21% voting power)  \n    - Soul Patts: 1,106,054 (4.15%)  \n    - Pengana Capital Group (PCG): 816,800 (3.06%)  \n  - **Current (12/06/2025)**: Total votes = 1,492,946 (5.58% voting power)  \n    - Soul Patts: 1,106,054 (4.13%)  \n    - PCG: 386,892 (1.45%)  \n- **Key Change**: PCG reduced its holding by 429,908 shares (from 3.06% to 1.45% voting power).  \n- **No change in Soul Patts' direct holdings**; minor dilution due to increased total shares outstanding (26,760,004).  \n\n### Implication:  \nReduction in PCG's stake may signal a shift in institutional interest, but Soul Patts' unchanged holding suggests stability in core ownership.",
