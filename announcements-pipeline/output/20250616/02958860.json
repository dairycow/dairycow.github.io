  "summary": "Here\u2019s the concise extraction of material information from the announcement:\n\n### **Key Highlights (Operational/Flow Test Results)**  \n- **SS-2H ST1 IP30 flow rate**: 7.2 MMcf/d (normalized to 13.2 MMcf/d over 10,000 ft), a Beetaloo Basin record.  \n- **Comparison to Marcellus Shale**: Performance aligns with average of >11,000 wells in the dry gas region.  \n- **Reservoir performance**: Steady decline rates mirror SS-1H, indicating sustained pressure and fracture conductivity.  \n- **Completion improvements**: 35 stages at 2,710 lb/ft proppant intensity (+26% vs. SS-1H); optimized \"US-style\" design.  \n\n### **Upcoming Catalysts**  \n- **2H 2025**: Drilling of SS-4H/5H/6H wells (target: <25 days spud-to-TD per well).  \n- **4Q 2025\u20131H 2026**: Batch stimulation of SS-3H/4H/5H/6H; 30-day flow test of one well.  \n- **Mid-2026 target**: First gas sales from SS Pilot Project (40 MMcf/d gross, ~19 MMcf/d net).  \n\n### **Cost Reductions**  \n- **Local sand procurement**: Secured at ~US$0.07/lb (70% cheaper than 2024 imported sand).  \n- **Potential 2026 sand mine**: Could reduce costs further to <US$0.05/lb.  \n\n### **Risks/Qualifiers**  \n- Timing contingent on regulatory/stakeholder approvals and weather.  \n\n**Omitted**: Forward-looking disclaimers, operational minutiae, historical comparisons.",
