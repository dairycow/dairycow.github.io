  "summary": "- **Drilling Program**: Commenced 5,000m diamond core drilling at Kobada Gold Project (Mali) targeting depth extensions below current 2.2Moz Mineral Resource.  \n- **Exploration Focus**: Testing untested down-dip/down-plunge mineralisation (historical high-grade intercepts include 9m at 21.0g/t and 3m at 33.9g/t).  \n- **Upcoming Activity**: RC drilling planned for near-surface oxide targets to expand resource base.  \n- **Project Milestones**: Advancing toward Final Investment Decision (FID) by end-2025; geotechnical data to optimise mine design.  \n- **Resource/Reserve Summary**:  \n  - **MRE**: 78Mt at 0.88g/t (2.20Moz Au), predominantly oxide (1.46Moz).  \n  - **Ore Reserves**: 53.8Mt at 0.90g/t (1.56Moz Au).  \n\nNo capital raising or trading halt details identified. Focus on resource growth and development pathway.",
