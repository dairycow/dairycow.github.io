  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n- **Drilling Program Commenced**: 5,000m diamond core drilling at Kobada Gold Project targeting depth extensions below current 2.2Moz Mineral Resource (oxide-dominated, open-pitable).  \n- **Exploration Upside**: Potential to expand resource inventory and mine life; shallow RC drilling planned later in 2025 for near-surface oxide targets.  \n- **Project Milestones**: Final Investment Decision (FID) targeted by end-2025; drilling supports mine design optimization and permitting progress.  \n- **Historical High-Grade Intercepts**: Include 9m at 21.0g/t and 32.4m at 1.70g/t, indicating mineralization potential at depth.  \n\n*No capital raising, financial data, or immediate trading catalysts identified.*",
