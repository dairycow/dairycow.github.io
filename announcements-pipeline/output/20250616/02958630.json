  "summary": "**Key Material Information:**  \n- **Preclinical breakthrough**: NUZ-001 and its metabolite NUZ-001 Sulfone showed significant neuroprotective effects in a zebrafish model of Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), rescuing key pathological markers (morphological abnormalities, neuronal cell death, BDNF expression, and haemoglobin levels).  \n- **Platform potential**: Results reinforce NUZ-001\u2019s broader applicability as a potential disease-modifying therapy for neurodegenerative diseases beyond ALS.  \n- **Next steps**: Mammalian model studies planned to validate findings, indicating pipeline expansion into HD.  \n\n**Valuation Impact**: Positive preclinical data may enhance investor sentiment around NUZ-001's therapeutic potential and market opportunity in HD (no current disease-modifying treatments; global prevalence 2.7\u20134.8 per 100,000).  \n\n*Omitted: Background on HD, operational details, director commentary, and figures.*",
