  "summary": "- **Drilling Results**: RC drilling at K6 Prospect confirmed gold/cobalt/copper mineralization, extending the known mineralized trend by ~2.5km. Best intersection: 2m @ 0.27 g/t Au, 0.13% Co, 0.35% Cu (K6RC009).  \n- **Exploration Potential**: Untested targets along the 2.5km trend could expand Mineral Resources. IP chargeability anomalies suggest deeper mineralized systems.  \n- **RC Drilling Viability**: Demonstrated as cost-effective for shallow targets (~50% cheaper than diamond drilling), enabling faster exploration.  \n- **Next Steps**: Geochemical review and deeper drilling planned to target higher-grade core zones.  \n\n*No material capital markets or trading-specific information (e.g., raising, halts) identified.*",
