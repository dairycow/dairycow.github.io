  "summary": "- **Initial drill results**:  \n  - First drill hole (SB-25-01) intersected a **0.7m mineralised quartz vein** at 107.4m (gold-associated sulphides; assays pending).  \n  - Confirmed structural model with fault at 52.0m (2.5m true width).  \n  - Second drill hole (SB-25-02) in progress, validating vein offset.  \n\n- **Program scale**:  \n  - First 2 holes of a **25-hole drill program** targeting 7km+ of mineralised veins.  \n  - **Second drill rig** to be added soon (subject to financing).  \n\n- **Exploration target**:  \n  - Previously announced **2-4Mt at 20-30 g/t Au** (April 2025); drilling now testing this target.  \n\n- **Project context**:  \n  - Santa Barbara is a **high-grade mesothermal gold project** with epithermal overprint.  \n  - Potential for **small profitable mine** or larger resource (speculative upside).  \n\n*No other material financial, capital structure, or trading-related information identified.*",
