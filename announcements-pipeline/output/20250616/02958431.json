  "summary": "**Material Information Summary:**  \n\n- **Substantial Holding Disclosure**: **BGH Capital** and its associated entities (via SPV **5382917 Limited**) have acquired a **17.795% stake** in **Tourism Holdings Limited (THL)** (NZX: THL), totaling **39,345,432 shares**.  \n- **Breakdown of Holdings**:  \n  - **26,079,549 shares** (11.795%) held via agreements with **Trouchet Shareholders** (lock-up until earlier of 14 Dec 2025 or transaction execution).  \n  - **13,265,883 shares** (6.000%) acquired via on-market purchases from **ANZ** (8,843,922 shares at **NZ$2.30/share**) and **ACC** (4,421,961 shares at **NZ$2.25/share**), settling **18 June 2025**.  \n- **Top-Up Mechanisms**:  \n  - If SPV/BGH acquires full control (via scheme/takeover) within **12 months** at a higher price, sellers receive the difference vs. agreed sale prices.  \n  - Matching payments triggered if SPV buys additional shares at prices >5c above acquisition prices within **20 business days**.  \n- **Strategic Intent**: BGH/Trouchet collaboration to explore **takeover or scheme of arrangement** for THL, with exclusivity until **14 Dec 2025**.  \n\n**Key Impact**: Potential catalyst for THL\u2019s valuation due to **strategic stake accumulation** and looming control transaction. Pricing mechanisms suggest upside if higher bid emerges.",
