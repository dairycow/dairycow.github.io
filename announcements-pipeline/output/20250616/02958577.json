  "summary": "**Funding Update Summary:**  \n- **Directorship Loan Facility**: Managing Director Ilario Faenza provides **up to AUD 500k** (initial **AUD 200k drawn immediately**) for working capital.  \n- **Key Terms**:  \n  - Unsecured, **15% interest** (paid at term end).  \n  - Repayment conditions tied to **future capital raise** (participation option or cash repayment).  \n  - Shareholder approval required if repayment via securities; otherwise, cash repayment by **31 December 2025** or earlier if capital raise completed/refused.  \n\n*Material Implications*: Temporary liquidity relief but signals potential near-term capital raising activity. High interest rate (15%) reflects credit risk. Watch for upcoming capital raise announcement.  \n\n**Omitted**: Corporate boilerplate, contact details, forward-looking statements.",
