  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement \u2013 Delorean Corporation Ltd (25th June 2025)  \n\n**Material Regulatory Reforms Impacting Valuation:**  \n- **NGER Scheme Changes (effective 1 July 2025):**  \n  - Biomethane and hydrogen formally recognised as fuel types, enabling RGGO certificates for Scope 1 emissions reduction.  \n  - Companies using RGGO-certified biomethane can report lower emissions starting 2025\u201326 (first reports due 31 Oct 2026).  \n\n- **AS 4564:2025 (effective 12 June 2025):**  \n  - Biomethane now classified as \"natural gas equivalent\" with relaxed oxygen (1% mol vs. 0.2%) and tailored contaminant thresholds, reducing upgrade costs.  \n\n**Strategic Implications for Delorean:**  \n- **SA1 Bioenergy Project (Adelaide):** GreenPower-registered; RGGO certificate issuance imminent upon biomethane delivery.  \n- Regulatory clarity reduces project risk, accelerates commercialization, and enhances revenue from biomethane and RGGOs.  \n\n**No capital raising, financial data, or trading halt requested.**",
