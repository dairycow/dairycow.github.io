  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Exploration Milestone**: Successful TEM simulation confirms ability to detect high-value copper-gold (IOCG) deposits at **depths >1,000m** at Olympic Domain Project (5km from BHP\u2019s Oak Dam Deposit).  \n- **Key Targets Identified**:  \n  - **4.2km conductive anomaly** (open to north) with adjacent drill intercepts (e.g., 115m @ 0.32% CuEq).  \n  - **Gravity anomaly (JH100)**: Untested, aligns with AMT data, potential for dense mineralised IOCG system.  \n  - **Phase anomaly**: Indicates possible IOCG feeder zone; historic drilling (e.g., 115m @ 0.64% CuEq) narrowly missed core.  \n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - TEM survey (final step before drill program), government grant applications, and JV/earn-in discussions.  \n- **Geophysics Team**: Led by experts behind major discoveries (e.g., Carrapateena, Havieron).  \n\n**No capital-raising, financials, or trading halt details identified.**  \n\n*Summary tailored for exploration-impact relevance; excludes operational/legal boilerplate.*",
