  "summary": "**Summary of ASX Announcement - Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) Re-establishment**  \n\n- **DRP Re-established**: Ignite Limited (ASX:IGN) reintroduces its Dividend Reinvestment Plan.  \n- **Key Flexible Terms**:  \n  - Directors will decide dividend-by-dividend whether the DRP applies and if a **discount** to market price will be offered (details announced with each dividend).  \n  - Existing DRP elections (some dating back to 2012) will be honored.  \n  - Participation can be full, partial, or none; adjustable before each dividend's record date.  \n- **Capital Structure Impact**:  \n  - DRP shares **do not count** toward the 15% annual placement cap under ASX Listing Rules.  \n  - Directors may participate without shareholder approval.  \n- **Practical Details**:  \n  - No fees/commissions; shares issued at volume-weighted average price (VWAP) post-record date.  \n  - **Rounding down** to whole shares; residual cash carried forward for future DRP allocations.  \n\n**Material Relevance**:  \n- Enhances capital flexibility for future equity issuance without dilution constraints.  \n- Potential liquidity impact if DRP participation reduces cash dividend outflows.  \n\n*Omitted: FAQs, registry instructions, tax disclaimers (routine/non-material).*",
