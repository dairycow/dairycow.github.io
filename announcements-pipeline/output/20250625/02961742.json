  "summary": "Here's the concise extraction of material information from the ASX announcement:\n\n**Material Information for Capital Markets/Trading Decisions:**  \n- **Exploration Results:**  \n  - Confirmed **Ionic Adsorption Clay (IAC) characteristics** at Cap\u00e3o Bonito project, with strong rare earth oxide (REO) recoveries (>50% MREO) via ammonium sulphate leach (AMSUL) testing.  \n  - **High-grade intercepts** (near-surface):  \n    - 10m @ 66% MREO extraction (CBAD-0005)  \n    - 14m @ 55% MREO (CPO-TD0013)  \n    - 10m @ 89% MREO (CPO-TD0039, pending top 4m results)  \n    - 7m @ 77% MREO (CPO-TD0040).  \n  - **Strategic significance:** IAC deposits are rare outside China, offering low-cost, environmentally benign processing critical for EV/renewable energy supply chains.  \n\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Follow-up drilling (late July) to test high-recovery zones.  \n  - Infill drilling (400m spacing) to confirm mineralization continuity.  \n  - Metallurgical optimization and mineralogical analysis (19 priority samples).  \n\n- **Strategic Impact:** Results position Cap\u00e3o Bonito as a **high-potential REE discovery**, potentially enhancing PVW\u2019s valuation as a clean energy materials player.  \n\n**Omitted:** Non-material operational details, JORC technical appendices, and routine corporate updates.  \n\n*Tailored for traders/investors focusing on catalytic exploration results and project scalability.*",
