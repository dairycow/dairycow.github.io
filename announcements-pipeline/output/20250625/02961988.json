  "summary": "No material information identified.  \n\n*Reason*: Appendix 3Y notice merely discloses a director's on-market share acquisition (105,957 shares at $0.4397 per share), with no impact on liquidity, capital structure, or valuation. No closed-period breach. Omitted as immaterial for trading or capital markets decisions.  \n\n(Note: Standard director interest disclosures rarely warrant action unless indicating significant insider transactions or signalling strategic shifts.)",
