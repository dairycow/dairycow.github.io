  "summary": "**Material Information Summary:**  \n\n- **Queensland Government Funding Approval:** Granted **$189,200** under the Collaborative Exploration Initiative (CEI) for geophysical surveys at the **Bajool Prospect** (Capricorn Gold-Copper Belt Project).  \n- **Exploration Target:** Bajool Prospect identified as a **porphyry copper-molybdenum system**. Planned 3D DCIP and MT surveys aim to model mineralization for future drilling.  \n- **Historic Drill Results:** Re-assayed core from hole D28-DDH4 returned:  \n  - **16m @ 0.57% Cu, 441ppm Mo** (from 156m), including **2m @ 3.22% Cu, 252ppm Mo, 17.7ppm Ag**.  \n- **Project Acquisition Update:** Tranche 1 (51% interest) of Capricorn Project tenements pending execution of native title access agreements.  \n\n**Key Implications:**  \n- Funding reduces exploration costs for high-priority target.  \n- High-grade Cu-Mo intercepts validate prospectivity.  \n- Transaction completion (Tranche 1) remains subject to approvals.  \n\n*Omitted:* Background geology, non-material operational details, JORC boilerplate.",
