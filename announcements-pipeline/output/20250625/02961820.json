  "summary": "**Summary of ASX Announcement:**  \n- **Capital Raising Structure**: Multi-tranche convertible notes and subordinated debt by Bally's ($300m principal) and Investment Holdings ($100m).  \n- **Material Dilution Risk**: Conversion could result in Bally's and Investment Holdings collectively owning >50% of shares (breaching 20% individual thresholds).  \n- **Key Rationale**: Funding critical to avoid voluntary administration amid financial/legal uncertainty (including pending AUSTRAC judgment).  \n- **Independent Expert View**: Deems the deals \"not fair\" technically but \"reasonable\" for shareholders given operational survival risk.  \n- **Board Recommendation**: Unanimous approval urged for both strategic investments and prior note issuance ratification.  \n\n*Omitted: Meeting logistics, historical context, boilerplate.*",
