  "summary": "- **Strategic Investment Structure**: $300M multi-tranche convertible note and subordinated debt instrument with Bally's; largest shareholder commits to $100M.  \n- **Key Approval Requirement**: Shareholder approval needed under Corps Act s611 due to potential >50% combined stake post-conversion (Bally's + Investment Holdings).  \n- **Rationale**: Funding critical to avoid voluntary administration amid operational uncertainty and pending AUSTRAC judgment (hearing concluded 11 June 2025).  \n- **Independent Expert Conclusion**: Deals \"not fair\" but \"reasonable\" for non-associated shareholders; rejection risks worse outcomes.  \n- **Placement Capacity Ratification**: Shareholder approval sought for prior issuance of 278.5M Tranche 1A (Bally's) and 139.3M Tranche 1B (Investment Holdings) convertible notes.  \n- **Board Recommendation**: Unanimous support for resolutions.  \n\nOmitted: Explanatory memo details, routine governance, contact info.",
