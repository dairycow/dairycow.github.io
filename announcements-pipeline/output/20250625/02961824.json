  "summary": "### Summary of Material Information:\n- **Exploration Results**:  \n  - Completed 20-hole aircore drilling program (1,520m) at Edjudina Range gold discovery (WA).  \n  - Key intercepts from resampling:  \n    - 16m @ 1.13g/t Au (RC hole EDRRC001)  \n    - 2m @ 5.16g/t Au (EDRAC030)  \n    - 4m @ 1.81g/t Au (EDRAC051)  \n  - >1km strike length of gold mineralisation identified, open along strike.  \n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Assay results from aircore drilling expected in coming weeks.  \n  - Follow-up RC drilling planned to test strike extensions and plunge targets.  \n- **Other Prospects**:  \n  - RC drilling imminent at Bluetooth Prospect (24km NW; recent intercept: 20m @ 2.18g/t Au) and Statesman Well (9km SE; recent intercept: 8m @ 7.94g/t Au).  \n- **Financial Position**:  \n  - Cash balance: **$13.6M** (as of 31 March 2025) + **$2.13M** from recent placement to Paradice Investment Management.  \n\n**Material Impact**: Results reinforce potential for near-surface gold resources; upcoming RC drilling and assays could further delineate mineralisation. Cash position supports continued exploration.  \n\n*No capital raising, trading halt, or other material corporate actions identified.*",
