  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement \u2013 Ardea Resources Limited (ARL)  \n\n**Type:** Exploration Results (Drilling Update)  \n\n#### **Material Information:**  \n- **Project:** Highway nickel-cobalt deposit (part of Kalgoorlie Nickel Project's Goongarrie Hub).  \n- **Key Results:**  \n  - **High-grade intercepts** from infill drilling (selected highlights):  \n    - **14m at 1.19% Ni** (from 30m), including **10m at 1.43% Ni**.  \n    - **20m at 1.12% Ni** (from 26m), including **6m at 2.38% Ni**.  \n    - **72m at 0.92% Ni** (from 12m), including **38m at 1.05% Ni**.  \n  - **Objective:** Drill program aimed at upgrading Mineral Resource classification to Measured (for DFS).  \n  - **Drilling Complete:** 165 RC holes (10,058m) at Highway. Results validate 2023 PFS pit modeling.  \n  - **Next Steps:**  \n    - Awaiting assays from **Goongarrie South** (highest-grade deposit).  \n    - Updated Mineral Resource Estimates (MREs) for Highway, Big Four, Scotia Dam, and Goongarrie South to follow.  \n    - DFS mine planning and Ore Reserve definition in progress.  \n\n#### **Operational Context:**  \n- **DFS Budget:** $98.5M (funded by consortium: Sumitomo Metal Mining and Mitsubishi Corporation).  \n- **Resource Scale:** Goongarrie Hub hosts **4.0Mt contained nickel** (584Mt at 0.69% Ni, 0.043% Co).  \n\n**No capital raising, trading halt, or material financial adjustments identified.**  \n\n---  \n*Note: Excludes non-material details (JORC tables, historical drilling, and routine operational commentary).*",
