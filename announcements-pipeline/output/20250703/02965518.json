  "summary": "- **Key Milestone**: Archer achieved on-chip electrical detection of magnetic resonance (EDMR) in its carbon-based qubit material, enabling a scalable readout method for quantum applications.  \n- **Potential Applications**: Technology applicable to quantum computing (qubit readout) and high-sensitivity magnetic sensors for biomedical, defense, and navigation uses.  \n- **Technical Advantage**: EDMR offers simpler, cheaper, and more integrable hardware compared to traditional optical readout systems (e.g., diamond-based).  \n- **Progress**: Early results confirmed at cryogenic temperatures (17\u201325 K); focus now on improving signal-to-noise ratios at higher temperatures and integrating into practical devices.  \n\n*No capital markets or trading-specific information identified (e.g., no raising, timetable, or financial data).*",
