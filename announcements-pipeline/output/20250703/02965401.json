  "summary": "Here's the concise material information extraction for trading/capital markets decisions:\n\n**Exploration Results Announcement (Kokoseb Gold Project):**\n- **Key Highlights:**\n  - Best intercept to date: **50m at 12.00 g/t Au** (including 1m at 528 g/t Au) in drill hole KRC437.\n  - Multiple high-grade intercepts:  \n    - 24m at 2.42 g/t Au  \n    - 118.3m at 1.46 g/t Au (unconstrained intercept)  \n    - 9.7m at 4.66 g/t Au (extending high-grade shoot).  \n  - All mineralized zones remain **open at depth/strike**, indicating further resource growth potential.\n\n- **Resource Impact:**  \n  - Results will be included in upcoming **Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE)** scheduled for July 2025.  \n  - Project currently hosts **2.12Moz inferred gold resources** (1.0 g/t Au cutoff). \n\n- **Operational Context:**  \n  - Kokoseb is located in Namibia (stable mining jurisdiction).  \n  - Discovery cost: **<US$3/oz** (industry-low).  \n\n**Actionable Takeaways:**  \n- High-grade results likely to **positively impact resource upgrade** and project economics.  \n- Potential catalyst: **MRE update in July 2025** (watch for increased resource size/grade).  \n- Confirms continuity of mineralization, reducing geological risk.  \n\n*Omitted:* Routine drilling data tables, non-material operational details, JORC boilerplate.",
