  "summary": "No material information identified (Board appointment announcement with no direct impact on capital structure, trading, or liquidity).  \n\n*Rationale:* The announcement outlines the appointment of a Non-Executive Director with environmental/regulatory expertise but does not disclose financial, operational, or capital markets-related information (e.g., no equity issuance, material project milestone, or change in financial position). Board changes alone are not typically material for trading decisions unless linked to strategic transactions or funding events.",
