  "summary": "### **Exploration Update Summary (Mt Boggola Project, TechGen Metals Limited)**  \n\n- **High-priority IP targets identified**:  \n  - **MB1**: Chargeability >3x background (~34 mV/V), shallow depth (75\u2013100m), coincides with 13 rock chip samples >1% Cu (peak: **10.5% Cu**).  \n  - **MB2**: Chargeability ~3x background (~28 mV/V), correlates with high-grade rock chips (peak: **32.6% Cu, 48.8g/t Au, 3.92% Sb**).  \n- **Untested drill targets**: Neither MB1 nor MB2 has been drilled previously (Newcrest\u2019s closest hole missed targets by ~100m, yielding only 0.8% Cu).  \n- **Next steps**: Heritage surveys scheduled; drilling planned for late 2023.  \n\n### **Material Relevance**:  \n- Targets are high-grade and undrilled, representing **potential resource expansion catalysts**.  \n- Strong correlation between geophysical anomalies and surface mineralization supports exploration upside.  \n\n*No capital markets or trading-specific actions (e.g., capital raising, halt) identified.*",
