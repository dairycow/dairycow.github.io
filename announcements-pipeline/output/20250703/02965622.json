(now holds **80.81%** of Xanadu Mines, up from **78.91%**).  \n- **Change Details**: Acquired **43,390,635 shares** (2.9% increase) via takeover offer at **$0.08/share** (total consideration: ~$3.47M).  \n- **Takeover Status**: Offer declared unconditional, but shares not yet transferred to Bastion\u2019s name.  \n- **Associates**: Boroo Pte. Ltd. and related entities (TEG, TDB, ESL, GBL) also hold indirect control over Bastion\u2019s stake.  \n\n**Key Implication**: Near-controlling stake (80.81%) suggests potential delisting or further consolidation. Monitor for offer extensions or compulsory acquisition notices.  \n\n*No other material information identified.*",
