  "summary": "- **High-grade antimony (Sb) mineralisation confirmed** at Azure Coast deposit (adjacent to Ricciardo deposit), with significant intercepts:\n  - 8m @ 1.73% Sb and 0.21g/t Au (including 1m @ 9.85% Sb)\n  - 6m @ 0.96% Sb (including 3m @ 1.62% Sb)\n  - 7m @ 0.71% Sb and 0.62g/t Au (including 1m @ 2.08% Sb and 2.96g/t Au)  \n\n- **Mineralisation remains open at depth and strike**, with historical drilling insufficient to delineate full extent.  \n- **Only 286 of ~2,500 holes at Azure Coast previously assayed for Sb**, indicating significant exploration upside.  \n- **Further drilling planned for Q3 CY2025** to extend gold and antimony targets.  \n- **Ricciardo deposit holds Australia\u2019s largest open-pit Sb resource** (60,254t Sb in 12.2Mt @ 0.5% Sb), reinforcing Azure Coast\u2019s potential.  \n\n*No capital markets actions or material financial impacts identified in this release.*",
