  "summary": "- **Panel Order Variation**: Voting restrictions on ARN Media Limited's 6.83% stake in Southern Cross Media (SXL) to be partially lifted every 6 months, allowing 3% voting power creep per period.  \n- **Key Change**: ARN can incrementally vote more shares (7,196,974 every 6 months starting 1 July 2025) until restrictions fully lapse.  \n- **Context**: Sandon Capital\u2019s request to vote shares for board spill resolutions was rejected, but Panel introduced a phased easing of restrictions.  \n\n*No material trading or capital markets impact identified beyond voting rights adjustment.*",
