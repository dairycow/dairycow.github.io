Below is the concise material information relevant for capital markets decisions:  \n\n### **Key Takeaways**:  \n1. **Plan Purpose**:  \n   - Establishes a framework for granting **Rights**, **Options**, and **Restricted Securities** to Eligible Employees.  \n\n2. **Incentive Types**:  \n   - **Rights**: Entitlement to Stapled Securities (or cash equivalent) upon vesting.  \n   - **Options**: Entitlement to Stapled Securities (or cash equivalent) upon exercise (may include an **Exercise Price**).  \n   - **Restricted Securities**: Stapled Securities subject to vesting conditions and restrictions on dealing.  \n\n3. **Key Vesting & Exercise Terms**:  \n   - **Vesting Conditions**: Determined by the Board (e.g., performance, tenure).  \n   - **Change of Control**: Unvested incentives may accelerate vesting or lapse.  \n   - **Forfeiture**: Applies if employment terminates or conditions are unmet.  \n\n4. **Tax & Compliance**:  \n   - **Australian Tax Treatment**: References to **Subdivision 83A-C** (tax deferral for employee share schemes).  \n   - **Non-Australian Participants**: Additional rules may apply based on jurisdiction.  \n\n5. **Governance**:  \n   - **Board Discretion**: Broad powers to amend, suspend, or terminate the plan (subject to participant consent requirements for adverse changes).  \n   - **Securities Dealing Policy**: Restrictions on trading during blackout periods.  \n\n6. **Material Impact on Capital Structure**:  \n   - Potential dilution from issuance of Stapled Securities upon vesting/exercise.  \n   - No specific capital raising disclosed (plan is for employee incentives, not external funding).  \n\n**Conclusion**: This is a standard equity incentive plan document; no immediate trading impact is evident, but future dilution may occur if incentives vest.  \n\n**No material trading or capital-raising actions identified in this announcement.**",
