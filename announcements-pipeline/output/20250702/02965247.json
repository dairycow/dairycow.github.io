  "summary": "This appears to be a product listing for CitiFirst MINIs (leveraged equity instruments) across single stocks, indices, currencies, and commodities. However, the document type is unclear, and it lacks material corporate actions or market-moving information typically found in ASX announcements.  \n\n**Summary:**  \n- No material information for trading or capital markets decisions identified  \n- Document appears to be a standard product catalogue (not a corporate announcement)  \n\nKey reasons:  \n1. No corporate actions (capital raises, M&A, guidance updates)  \n2. No operational/financial results  \n3. No material changes to capital structure or liquidity  \n\nRecommend checking ASX platform for original announcement type if further context is needed.",
