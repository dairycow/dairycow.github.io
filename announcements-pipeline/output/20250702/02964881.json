  "summary": "Here\u2019s the concise extraction of material information from the ASX announcement:  \n\n- **Exploration Update**:  \n  - Geophysical program underway to identify enriched rare earths (REE) and niobium zones at Arax\u00e1 Project (Brazil).  \n  - Targeting high-grade mineralization with historical intercepts up to **8% Nb\u2082O\u2085**, **33% TREO**, and **32% P\u2082O\u2085**.  \n  - **Current Work**:  \n    - Airborne magnetic survey (25m spacing, 270 flight km).  \n    - Passive seismic survey (HVSR method, 50m x 50m grid) to commence soon.  \n  - **Drilling**: 10,000m+ campaign ongoing; first assay results expected July 2025.  \n  - **Resource Potential**: Maiden JORC resource open in all directions; <10% of project area drilled.  \n\n- **Key Metrics (from maiden JORC MRE, April 2025)**:  \n  - **Niobium**: 41.2Mt @ **0.68% Nb\u2082O\u2085** (6,800ppm).  \n  - **Rare Earths**: 40.6Mt @ **4.13% TREO** (41,300ppm), including **0.78% MREO**.  \n\n**No capital raising, trading halt, or financial data disclosed**. Material focus is on exploration progress and resource expansion potential.  \n\n*Summary tailored to market-sensitive details; excludes operational/technical minutiae.*",
