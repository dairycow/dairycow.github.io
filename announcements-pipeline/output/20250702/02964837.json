  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (C29 Metals)  \n\n**Strategic Shift & Project Focus:**  \n- **Exit Kazakhstan**: Termination of operations due to unresolved regulatory hurdles; surrender of Kazakh tenements in progress.  \n- **Termination of HOA**: Binding Heads of Agreement with Bask International terminated.  \n- **Refocus on Mayfield Project (QLD)**:  \n  - 3-year exploration license extension secured (expires March 2028).  \n  - Geophysical anomalies (gravity/IP) correlate with copper/gold mineralization (e.g., 12m @ 1.55% Cu in drilling).  \n  - Targets: Mylonite-hosted gold and ironstone-hosted Cu-Au systems.  \n\n**Operational Highlights:**  \n- Historic drilling at Mayfield includes:  \n  - **Clarries Prospect**: 75m @ 0.21% Cu (intersected in 2023).  \n  - **Trekelano South**: Proximity to past-producing mine (3.1Mt @ 2.1% Cu, 0.64g/t Au).  \n\n**No new material exploration data** (per ASX Listing Rule 5.23).  \n\n**Critical Impact:**  \n- Strategic pivot to Australian assets may alter valuation focus; exit from Kazakhstan reduces geopolitical risk but abandons potential resource upside.  \n- License extension and confirmed mineralization at Mayfield support near-term exploration upside.  \n\n**Actionable Catalyst:** Planned exploration at Mayfield (timeline undisclosed).  \n\n---  \n*No capital raising, financials, or definitive timetable disclosed.*",
