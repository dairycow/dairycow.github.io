  "summary": "**Material Information Summary (Exploration Update Announcement):**  \n\n- **Phase 2 surface sampling commenced** at East Salinas (Brazil) targeting high-priority REE zones (Naked Hill, Bald Hill), with **anomalous grades up to 1.87% TREO** (Total Rare Earth Oxides).  \n- **Focus on MREE/HREE distribution**: Infill sampling and bulk samples (3x 100kg) collected for metallurgical testing (grinding, assay, mineralogy).  \n- **Drilling planned to commence by end-July 2025**; aims to refine targets and advance toward resource delineation.  \n- **Positive early metallurgical results**: Bond Work Index tests support low-cost gravity-based processing potential.  \n- **Tenement status**: 22,706-ha package held by Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Parana\u00ed Ltda; transfer to Enova pending final permit approval.  \n\n*Omitted: Routine operational details, forward-looking disclaimers, jurisdictional overviews.*",
