  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Strategic Project Announcement**:  \n  - New CSIRO-backed project to upgrade recovered graphite from battery waste into battery-grade anode material.  \n  - Potential **~25% revenue uplift** from commercial-scale battery recycling (assumes 8,400tpa graphite at ~$7,000/t).  \n  - **Project timeline**: July 2025 \u2013 November 2025.  \n  - Total funding: **$84,000** (government grant + CSIRO Kick-Start).  \n  - Successful IP to be **exclusively licensed** to Iondrive.  \n\n- **Market Opportunity**:  \n  - Graphite constitutes ~50% of lithium-ion battery weight but is often undervalued in recycling.  \n  - Global demand for anode-grade graphite rising, with China dominating supply (>90%).  \n  - Synthetic graphite prices: **>US$7,000/t** (April 2025 BMI data).  \n\nThis summary captures key financial, commercial, and strategic impacts while omitting non-material details.",
