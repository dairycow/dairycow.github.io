  "summary": "- **Lapse of option agreements**: QXR has decided to let its options to acquire a 15% interest in IGX and a 25% interest in IGL (holders of US lithium brine projects) lapse due to softening lithium market conditions and strategic focus on Australian gold and iron ore ventures.  \n- **Strategic shift**: Company reallocating capital away from lithium brine projects to prioritize Australian gold portfolio and Western Shaw iron ore JV.  \n\n*No other material information identified.*",
