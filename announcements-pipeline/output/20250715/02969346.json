  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary \u2013 Western Yilgarn NL (ASX: WYX)**  \n\n#### **Key Points:**  \n- **Maiden JORC (2012) Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate:**  \n  - **New Norcia Bauxite Project:** **39.27Mt** at **22.7% Available Al\u2082O\u2083** and **12.8% Reactive SiO\u2082** (cut-off: \u226525% Al\u2082O\u2083).  \n  - **Total Bauxite Resources (Group-Wide):** **244Mt** (includes Julimar West, Cardea 2, and Cardea 3 projects).  \n  - **Mineralisation Depth:** Surface to **7m vertical depth**, ~3km strike length and ~2km width.  \n\n- **Infrastructure & Location:**  \n  - Proximity to Perth (~120km north) and key transport routes (Great Northern Highway, Millendon Junction Narngulu Railway).  \n  - Potential for **Direct Shipping Ore (DSO)** operations targeting alumina refineries in China/Middle East.  \n\n- **Exploration Upside:**  \n  - **1.7km \u00d7 1.5km untested area** identified for further drilling.  \n  - Metallurgical tests show potential for **beneficiation** (e.g., wet screening to upgrade Al\u2082O\u2083 to ~50%).  \n\n- **Competent Person Statement:**  \n  - Estimate prepared by **Odessa Resources Pty Ltd** (Alfred Gillman, FAusIMM). No material changes to assumptions.  \n\n#### **Next Steps:**  \n- Additional drilling planned to expand resources in untested zones.  \n- Focus on metallurgical optimization and feasibility for DSO operations.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Significant resource upgrade with strategic infrastructure advantages; potential for further growth.  \n\n*(No capital raising, trading halt, or financials disclosed.)*",
