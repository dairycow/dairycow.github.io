  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **1. Merger Completion**:  \n- Amcor plc completed its merger with Berry Global Group, Inc. on **April 30, 2025**.  \n- Total equity consideration: **$8.2B** (7.25 Amcor shares per Berry share).  \n- Debt assumed/repaid: **$2.2B** (including refinancing of Berry\u2019s outstanding debt).  \n\n#### **2. Financing Transactions**:  \n- Amcor issued **$2.2B in unsecured notes** (weighted avg. interest rate: **5.14%**) to refinance Berry\u2019s debt.  \n- Bridge facility of **$1.75B** was committed but terminated after note issuance.  \n\n#### **3. Purchase Price Allocation**:  \n- **Total purchase price**: **$10.4B** (equity + debt repayment).  \n- **Goodwill**: **$6.8B** (preliminary).  \n- Fair value adjustments to inventory ($133M), PPE ($141M), and intangibles ($4.1B).  \n\n#### **4. Pro Forma Financial Impact**:  \n- **FY2024 Revenue**: **$23.3B** (combined).  \n- **Net Income**: **$764M** (post-adjustments).  \n- **EPS (diluted)**: **$0.33** for FY2024; **$0.34** for 9M 2025.  \n\n#### **5. Key Debt Adjustments**:  \n- **Pro forma long-term debt**: **$14.5B** (vs. $8.6B Amcor standalone).  \n- Debt repayments include $1.8B of Berry debt extinguished at closing.  \n\n#### **6. Operational Adjustments**:  \n- Berry\u2019s **Health, Hygiene & Specialties (HHS) segment** was disposed of pre-merger.  \n- **Transaction costs**: $107M expensed.  \n\n---  \n**Conclusion**: The merger significantly expands Amcor\u2019s scale, with material impacts on capital structure (higher debt) and earnings (pro forma EPS dilution). Fair value adjustments and integration costs are key near-term considerations.  \n\n*No material updates on trading halts or capital raising beyond the merger details above.*",
