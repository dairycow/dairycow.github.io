  "summary": "### **Summary of ASX Announcement \u2013 Marimaca Copper Corp.**  \n\n#### **Key Material Information:**  \n**1. Cleansing Offer:**  \n- **Purpose:** Remove secondary trading restrictions under **section 708A(11)** of the Corporations Act for previously issued Placement Shares (issued without a prospectus).  \n- **Structure:** Nominal **placement of 100 new CDIs** at **A$10.65 each**, raising **A$1,065** (before costs).  \n- **Closing Date:** **16 July 2025** (or as extended).  \n\n**2. Background on Placement Shares:**  \n- **2,250,000 Shares** issued on **10 June 2025** and **3,061,416 Shares** on **13 June 2025** via a **Canadian private placement** (total **US$17.7M raised**).  \n- These shares were subject to a **4-month statutory hold period** in Canada; this offer enables on-market trading in Australia via CDIs.  \n\n**3. No Material Financial Impact:**  \n- Net proceeds after expenses: **Nil** (A$10,706 in costs, exceeding the A$1,065 raised).  \n- Existing cash reserves will cover excess costs.  \n\n**4. Capital Structure Post-Offer:**  \n- **Total CDIs/Shares outstanding:** **106,495,867** (minimal dilution from 100 new CDIs).  \n- **Substantial Shareholders:**  \n  - **Greenstone Resources LP (24%)**  \n  - **Assore International (16.33%)**  \n  - **Ithaki Ltd (14.07%)**.  \n\n**5. Key Risks Highlighted:**  \n- **DFS & Project Development Risks:** Pending Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) for Marimaca Copper Project (completion targeted by end-2025). Permitting (DIA submitted in Chile) remains unresolved.  \n- **Debtor Risk:** **US$9.8M owed** from Rayrock sale (legal proceedings ongoing).  \n- **Funding Needs:** Additional capital required for project development post-DFS.  \n- **Commodity Price & Operational Risks:** Exposure to copper price volatility, geopolitical risks in Chile.  \n\n**6. Legal & Compliance:**  \n- **No exposure period** applies to the cleansing offer.  \n- Prospectus lodged with ASIC on **15 July 2025**.  \n\n**7. Dividend Policy:**  \n- **No dividends** expected in the foreseeable future.  \n\n---\n\n### **Concise Takeaways for Trading/Capital Markets Decisions:**  \n- **No new capital raised** \u2013 offer is procedural to unlock liquidity for existing shares.  \n- **No immediate dilution** (100 CDIs negligible vs. 106.5M shares outstanding).  \n- **Monitor DFS completion (2025)** and permitting updates for project viability.  \n- **High-risk equity**: Speculative due to pre-production stage, leverage to copper prices, and jurisdictional risks.  \n\n**Action:** Low-impact announcement; focus remains on project milestones and copper market dynamics.  \n\n*Format: Bullet points extracted strictly from material info; omits legal boilerplate and non-trading-relevant details.*",
