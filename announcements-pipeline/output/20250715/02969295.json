  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (New Age Exploration Limited - Quarterly Activities Report, June 2025)  \n\n#### **Key Operational Highlights**  \n1. **Wagyu Gold Project (Pilbara, WA)**  \n   - High-grade gold intercepts from maiden RC drill program:  \n     - 8m @ 5.0g/t Au (including 1m @ 28.6g/t Au)  \n     - 4m @ 2.5g/t Au, 12m @ 1.0g/t Au, 3m @ 2.8g/t Au  \n   - 1km of continuous mineralisation confirmed across Target 1 and Target 10.  \n   - Supergene gold zones remain open along strike/depth; analogous to Hemi Gold Project (11.2Moz).  \n   - Next phase: Expand oxide zones and test deeper primary mineralisation.  \n\n2. **Lammerlaw Project (New Zealand)**  \n   - Phase 1 drilling completed (5 holes, 458m); assays pending.  \n   - Permit EP 61110 secured, expanding Otago footprint.  \n   - Phase 2 drilling planned for Q1 2026.  \n\n#### **Financial & Corporate Updates**  \n- **Cash Balance (30 June 2025):** A$557k (down from A$1.96m prior quarter).  \n- **Lochinvar Coal Project Sale:** Completed post-quarter, granting NAE a A$1/tonne royalty (first 15Mt).  \n- **Funding Runway:** 0.42 quarters of operating cash (per Appendix 5B); reliant on future capital raises.  \n\n#### **Material Risks**  \n- Limited cash reserves (A$557k) with significant exploration commitments.  \n- High-grade results at Wagyu suggest potential, but resource delineation pending.  \n\n**Verdict:** Exploration success at Wagyu is material, but liquidity concerns may pressure near-term valuation.",
