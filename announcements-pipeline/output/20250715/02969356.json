  "summary": "### **Key Material Information (Pure Resources ASX:PR1 - 15 July 2025)**  \n\n- **Graphite Potential Review Underway**  \n  - Reedy Creek granted mining lease being assessed for graphite, following adjacent McIntosh Graphite Project feasibility study (32.6Mt @ 4.25% TGC).  \n  - Focus on historical drilling (graphite schist units) and untested VTEM conductors for exploration upside.  \n\n- **Downstream & US Market Initiatives**  \n  - Discussions with US thermal management sector (heat sinks, weapons cooling).  \n  - R&D partnerships with US institutions (DoE-funded) for garnet/REE extraction and graphite applications.  \n\n- **Garnet Development Progress**  \n  - 3.3km garnet skarn strike length confirmed.  \n  - Metallurgical testing ongoing; samples prepped for end-user validation (abrasives, filtration).  \n\n- **Strategic Infrastructure & Commodity Diversification**  \n  - Mining lease (M80/416) near Copernicus haul road \u2013 potential processing hub.  \n  - Dual-commodity focus: battery-grade graphite + premium garnet for diversified revenue.  \n\n- **Next Steps**  \n  - Finalize garnet metallurgical testing for offtake discussions.  \n  - Formalize US collaborations and REE extraction tech partnerships.  \n\n*No capital or trading-specific actions (e.g., raises, halts) identified.*  \n\n---  \n**Style Note:** Omitted management commentary, forward-looking statements, and non-material operational details. Focused on catalysts (exploration, partnerships) and assets (infrastructure, resource potential).",
