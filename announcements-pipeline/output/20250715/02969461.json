  "summary": "I cannot directly access or review the content from external links, including the provided ASX announcement PDF. However, if you can paste the text of the announcement (or key sections), I can analyze it and extract the material information in the requested format.  \n\n**For example, if you provide details like:**  \n- The announcement type (e.g., capital raising, trading halt, quarterly).  \n- Key figures (e.g., AUD amounts, dates, percentages).  \n- Material operational/financial updates.  \n\nI can then generate a concise, tailored summary.  \n\n**Otherwise, the response would be:**  \n*\"No material information identified (link not accessible).\"*  \n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!",
