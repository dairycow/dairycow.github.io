  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Metallurgical Testwork Progress**:  \n  - Produced 34kg of Mixed Rare Earth Oxide (MREO) from 1,800L of Pregnant Leach Solution (PLS), a key step toward Mixed Rare Earth Carbonate (MREC) production.  \n  - Achieved **99% recovery of magnet rare earths (MRE: Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb)** via low-cost direct precipitation.  \n\n- **Cost Efficiency**:  \n  - Intermediate MREO step reduces downstream volumes by **~98%**, lowering equipment costs for MREC production.  \n\n- **Government Support**:  \n  - Testwork co-funded by **A$5 million** Australian Government grant.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Optimizing impurity removal and MREC precipitation for Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS).  \n\n**Note**: No capital raising, trading halt, or financial data disclosed. Focus on technical de-risking.",
