  "summary": "**Material Information Summary:**  \n\n- **Strategic Partnership Agreement:** Ubaryon (21.9% owned by GUE) executed a binding agreement with Urenco for uranium enrichment technology development.  \n- **Funding Commitment:** Urenco to invest **A$5.0 million** over 3 years plus technical support. GUE will invest **A$500,000** to maintain pro rata ownership (21.9%).  \n- **Technology Validation:** Ubaryon\u2019s enrichment tech independently assessed at **TRL-4** (lab-validated) with potential to simplify nuclear fuel supply chain.  \n\n**Valuation Impact:**  \n- Urenco\u2019s investment validates Ubaryon\u2019s tech and strengthens GUE\u2019s exposure to enriched uranium markets.  \n- No immediate capital raising or dilution; GUE\u2019s cash outlay is limited to A$500k to retain stake.  \n\n*Omitted:* Background details, director quotes, operational projects (unless material to the agreement\u2019s impact).",
