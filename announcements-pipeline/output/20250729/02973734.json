  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (ASX: FTL, dated 29 July 2025)  \n\n**Announcement Type:** Exploration Update  \n\n**Material Information:**  \n1. **Geophysical Interpretation:**  \n   - CSAMT/magnetics/IP surveys suggest the **Buster Trend** extends **>5km** (previously ~1km tested).  \n   - Identified parallel **Ghost Trend** with limited prior drilling.  \n   - Intrusive-related gold targets confirmed for drilling.  \n\n2. **New Exploration Targets:**  \n   - Undocumented adit found in **Buster Patented Claim area** (2\u20133m wide mineralisation; no prior sampling/drilling). Samples submitted for analysis.  \n\n3. **Upcoming Drilling:**  \n   - **Diamond drilling** to commence **August 2025**, targeting high-grade intercepts (e.g., 51.8m @ 4.00g/t Au).  \n\n4. **High-Grade Potential:**  \n   - Historical intercepts include 33.5m @ 5.35g/t Au and 24.4m @ 3.62g/t Au.  \n   - Blue Dick Mine area returned **6,630g/t Ag** in recent sampling (untested by drilling).  \n\n**Omitted:** Non-material operational details, director comments, and historical background.  \n\n**Valuation Impact:** Expansion of known mineralised trends and new drilling targets may enhance resource potential.",
