  "summary": "This appears to be a product disclosure document for CitiFirst Instalment MINIs (a type of structured product/derivative), not a standard ASX company announcement. Since no material corporate actions, financial results, or capital market events are disclosed, I would classify it as:\n\n**No material information identified**  \n\n(Note: The document provides indicative terms for MINI products, which are relevant for investors considering these instruments, but does not contain material announcements affecting ASX-listed companies' capital structures or trading conditions.)  \n\nFor MINI-specific analysis, key metrics would include gearing ratios, stop-loss triggers, and expiry dates - but these are not material to the underlying equities' trading decisions.",
