Quarterly Report (Appendix 4C) Highlights:**\n- **Exploration Results**:  \n  - High-grade gold intersections at Guyer Trend:  \n    - 3.65m @ 7.46 g/t Au (incl. 0.5m @ 50.2 g/t Au).  \n    - 6.52m @ 2.63 g/t Au (incl. 1.32m @ 6.59 g/t Au).  \n  - Aircore drilling identified three new +1,200m gold anomalies.  \n- **Capital Raising**:  \n  - Oversubscribed placement raised **$2.5M** (before costs) from institutional/sophisticated investors.  \n- **Cash Position**:  \n  - Closing cash balance: **$4.2M** (no debt).  \n\n**2. Operational Updates**:  \n- **Drilling Programs**:  \n  - Completed: 2,572m diamond drilling + 14,486m aircore drilling at Guyer Trend.  \n  - Upcoming: 11,700m RC drilling program underway.  \n- **Farm-In Agreement**:  \n  - $5M exploration commitment by Gold Road Resources (ASX: GOR) for Guyer Trend.  \n\n**3. Forward Plans**:  \n- **Guyer Trend**: 16,700m drilling program (4,000m aircore + 12,700m RC) to test new targets.  \n- **Welcome Creek Project**: Planning re-entry of historic drillhole LDDH001 (extending to 1,200m).  \n\n**4. Tenements**:  \n- All tenements in good standing; 3 new Mining Lease Applications (MLAs) filed.  \n\n**5. Liquidity**:  \n- Estimated funding runway: **1.24 quarters** (excluding farm-in reimbursements).  \n\n**Material Impact**: High-grade results and expanded drilling programs reinforce growth potential at Guyer Trend, while the capital raise ($2.5M) supports near-term exploration. Cash reserves ($4.2M) provide liquidity, but limited runway highlights potential future funding needs.  \n\n*Omitted: Routine operational details, director names, and non-material tenement specifics.*",
