  "summary": "### **Anson Resources Ltd \u2013 Quarterly Activities Report (June 2025) \u2013 Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Green River Lithium Project (Utah, USA)**  \n- **Maiden JORC Resource**: 103,000 tonnes LCE (lithium carbonate equivalent) from the Bosydaba #1 well.  \n- **Exploration Target**: 1,200\u20131,500 million tonnes brine at 100\u2013150 ppm Li (conceptual only, not a JORC Resource).  \n- **Resource Expansion**: Mt Fuel-Skyline Geyser 1-25 well re-entry approved (Q3 2025 target), expected to increase resources.  \n- **Higher-Grade Results**: Recent swabbing assays average **135 mg/l Li** (vs. maiden JORC\u2019s 93.5 mg/l), to be included in future updates.  \n- **Land Expansion**: Added **100 placer claims** (+10% land package), with 28% falling within the current JORC Resource area.  \n- **POSCO MOU**: Non-binding agreement for a **Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) demonstration plant** (due diligence completion expected by Dec 2025).  \n- **Royalty Reduction**: Utah state royalty reduced to **1\u20135%** (scaled with market conditions) from a flat 5%.  \n\n#### **Paradox Lithium Project (Utah, USA)**  \n- **JORC Resource**: **1.5Mt LCE + 7.6Mt bromine** (existing resource).  \n- **Drilling Plans**: Re-entry of Mineral Canyon Fed 1-3 well and Sunburst 1 pad to expand resources.  \n\n#### **Corporate & Financial**  \n- **Cash Balance**: **A$2.5M** at quarter-end.  \n- **Funding Facility**: **A$30M equity placement facility** (undrawn) amended to Dec 2026.  \n- **Cash Burn**: **A$1.86M** net operating outflow (quarter); **17.5 quarters** of funding runway based on current reserves + facility.  \n\n---  \n**Key Takeaways for Investors**:  \n1. **Resource growth potential** at Green River (upcoming drilling, higher-grade assays).  \n2. **Strategic partnership** with POSCO for DLE tech validation (catalyst: Dec 2025 due diligence).  \n3. **Improved economics** via reduced Utah royalties.  \n4. **Lean liquidity position** (A$2.5M cash), but undrawn A$30M facility provides flexibility.  \n\n*No material capital raising, M&A, or operational disruptions noted.*",
