  "summary": "**Exploration Update \u2013 Material Information Summary**  \n\n- **KM Prospect (Priority Target)**  \n  - Maiden drilling intersects thick, shallow phosphate mineralization:  \n    - **GADD-2025-005**: 34.6m from 24m depth  \n    - **GADD-2025-006**: 34m from 31m depth  \n    - **GADD-2025-003**: 15.5m from 52m depth (ongoing)  \n  - Low-strip ratio and proximity to planned plant site suggest **accelerated, low-cost development potential**.  \n  - Assays expected this quarter; drilling continues.  \n\n- **SAB Prospect**  \n  - **Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) underway**, targeting shallow mineralization. Results due this quarter.  \n\n- **Sekarna Exploration Permit**  \n  - **15% of permit area overlaps proposed nature reserve**, including exploration target. Engagement with authorities ongoing.  \n\n**Notes**:  \n- Visual/pXRF results are preliminary; lab assays pending.  \n- No capital raising, financials, or definitive resource figures disclosed.  \n\n*Summary excludes operational/technical details without material market impact.*",
