  "summary": "- **Director Resignations**: Nicholas Bolton (CEO of Keybridge Capital) and John Patton (non-executive director of Keybridge) have resigned from Yowie's board immediately due to conflicts arising from:  \n  - Yowie's takeover bid for Keybridge.  \n  - Keybridge's actions to avoid repaying $6.6M loans from Yowie, despite acknowledging the liability in audited financials.  \n\n- **Governance Change**: Yowie\u2019s board will now be entirely independent of Keybridge to uphold governance standards.  \n\n*No material trading or capital markets impact identified beyond governance adjustments.*",
