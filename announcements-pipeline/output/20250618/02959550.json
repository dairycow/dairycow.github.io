  "summary": "- **Director Resignations**: Nicholas Bolton (CEO of Keybridge Capital) and John Patton (Non-Executive Director of Keybridge) resigned from Yowie's board immediately due to conflicts arising from Yowie's takeover bid for Keybridge and Keybridge's actions to avoid repaying $6.6M in loans from Yowie.  \n- **Governance Impact**: Yowie's board believes a reduced, fully independent board (free of Keybridge ties) aligns with best practice governance.  \n\n*No other material trading or capital markets information identified.*",
