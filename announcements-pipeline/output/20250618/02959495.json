  "summary": "Here\u2019s a concise summary of the material information from the ASX announcement:\n\n### **Key Highlights (Exploration Results at Iguana Deposit)**  \n- **Drilling Program**: 201 RC drill holes (10,854m) completed at Iguana Stage 1 Pit (Lady Ida Project).  \n- **High-Grade Intercepts** (In-situ mineralisation):  \n  - 11m @ 9.57 g/t Au (from 15m)  \n  - 6m @ 14.15 g/t Au (from 28m)  \n  - 3m @ 27.00 g/t Au (from 13m)  \n  - 2m @ 42.65 g/t Au (from 25m)  \n- **Lateritic Mineralisation**: Shallow high-grade zones (e.g., 1m @ 5.32 g/t Au from surface).  \n- **Next Phase**: Second drilling phase targeting Iguana Stage 1 Pit inventory to commence July 2025.  \n\n### **Deposit Context**  \n- Hosted in sheared, altered amphibolite-facies metabasalt/sediments, controlled by thrust structures.  \n- Confirms extension of mineralisation beyond prior resource model.  \n\n### **Material Impact**  \n- Results support potential resource upgrade and mine planning for the Lady Ida Project.  \n\n**Format**: Strictly extracted key operational/financial metrics; omits non-material details (JORC tables, boilerplate).  \n\nLet me know if further granularity is needed.",
