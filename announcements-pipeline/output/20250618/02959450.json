  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n#### **1. Annual General and Special Meeting (AGM) Details**  \n- **Date & Time**: July 16, 2025 (6:00 pm EST) / July 17, 2025 (8:00 am AEST).  \n- **Virtual Meeting Link**: [https://s1.c-conf.com/diamondpass/10048034-whft5r.html](https://s1.c-conf.com/diamondpass/10048034-whft5r.html).  \n- **Record Date**: June 9, 2025 (shareholders as of this date can vote).  \n\n#### **2. Key Resolutions**  \n- **Director Elections**:  \n  - Christopher Eager, Philippe Martins, Anne Landry, Justin Clyne.  \n- **Auditor Appointment**: MNP LLP.  \n- **Special Resolution**: Approval for **additional 10% placement capacity** under ASX Listing Rule 7.1A (allowing issuance of equity securities up to 10% of issued capital over 12 months).  \n\n#### **3. Capital Structure & Shareholder Details**  \n- **Issued Shares**: 92,590,049 common shares outstanding.  \n- **Major Holders**:  \n  - Resmin Pte Ltd (19.7%, controlled by Chairman Christopher Eager).  \n  - Regal Funds Management (10.8%).  \n  - Warman Investments (11.6%).  \n\n#### **4. Dilution Risk from Placement Capacity**  \n- If fully utilized, the 10% placement could issue **9.26M new shares** (based on current shares).  \n- **Potential dilution**: Up to 10% economic/voting dilution (varies with issue price).  \n\n#### **5. Executive Compensation**  \n- **Stock Options**: 10.81M options outstanding (weighted avg. exercise price: AUD $0.28).  \n\n#### **6. Voting Instructions**  \n- **Deadline**: July 14, 2025 (6:00 pm EST).  \n- **Voting Exclusions**: Votes from parties benefiting from the placement resolution will be disregarded.  \n\n### **Why It Matters for Trading/Capital Markets**:  \n- **Liquidity Impact**: Potential equity dilution from the 10% placement approval.  \n- **Governance**: Re-election of key directors (Eager, Martins, Landry, Clyne) signals continuity.  \n- **Regulatory Waiver**: ASX granted a waiver allowing CDI holders to vote only \"For\" or \"Abstain\" on director/auditor resolutions.  \n\n**Actionable Takeaway**: Monitor trading volumes around the AGM date (July 16\u201317, 2025) for potential volatility linked to the placement capacity outcome.",
