  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (ASX: FTL)  \n\n#### **Material Information for Capital Markets/Trading**  \n- **Key Exploration Highlights (Skyline Copper Project, Canada):**  \n  - **Earl\u2019s Target:** Identified **800m strike trend** of copper-only VMS-style mineralization, suggesting potential for Cyprus-style deposits.  \n  - **High-grade rock chip results:** Up to **18.19% Cu**.  \n  - **Untested potential:** No prior geophysics (magnetic/IP/EM) completed; historical adits/waste dumps indicate undocumented high-grade workings.  \n  - **Upcoming surveys:**  \n    - **3DIP survey** underway at Governor\u2019s Target.  \n    - **UAV magnetic survey** (8km \u00d7 2.5km ophiolite sequence) planned for early July.  \n\n- **Due Diligence (US Gold Projects):**  \n  - **Excelsior Springs (Nevada):** Reprocessing geophysics and 3D modelling for drill targeting.  \n  - **Bella (South Dakota):** Data acquisition and targeting underway.  \n\n#### **Next Steps:**  \n- Geophysical surveys (3DIP, UAV magnetics) to refine drill targets.  \n- Transactions for US gold projects expected to close **late July**.  \n\n**No material capital-raising, financial, or timetable information identified.**  \n\n*Priority focus:* High-grade copper discovery and near-term geophysical results may impact valuation.  \n\n---  \n*Note: Operational updates on Peru projects (Picha/Charaque) omitted as non-material to immediate trading decisions.*",
