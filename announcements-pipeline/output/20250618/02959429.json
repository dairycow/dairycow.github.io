  "summary": "### Material Information Summary (Canterbury Resources \u2013 Briggs Drilling & Scoping Study Update)  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **Deep Drilling Program:**  \n  - 900m diamond drill hole planned for **July 2025**, targeting a high-priority VTEM geophysical anomaly southwest of the existing Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE).  \n  - VTEM target suggests potential for higher-grade copper sulphide mineralisation at depth.  \n  - Funded partially by a **$250k (+GST) Queensland Government grant**.  \n\n- **Briggs Scoping Study:**  \n  - On track for completion in **August 2025**.  \n  - Evaluating a **large-scale open-pit copper mine** with conventional processing (crushing/flotation).  \n  - Current MRE (0.15% Cu cut-off): **2.0Mt Cu, 73Mlb Mo, 16.5Moz Ag**.  \n\n- **Additional Drilling Planned:**  \n  - Infill drilling later in 2025 to upgrade MRE confidence.  \n  - Further exploration contingent on deep drill results.  \n\n- **Resource Context:**  \n  - Briggs is among Australia\u2019s largest undeveloped copper projects.  \n\n#### **Capital Markets Relevance:**  \n- No new capital raising or equity actions announced.  \n- Focus on exploration progress and near-term catalysts (drilling results, scoping study).  \n\n**Format note:** Excluded operational/joint venture boilerplate, director commentary, and JORC details.",
