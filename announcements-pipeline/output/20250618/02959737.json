  "summary": "- **Listing Rule 10.1 Breach**: ASX determined that shareholder approval was required for related-party lease renewals (Initial Leases, WA Lease, SA Lease) as they exceeded 5% equity threshold.  \n- **Proposed Remedy**: Shareholder approval to be sought for past/future lease payments via a general meeting; independent expert report commissioned.  \n- **Operational Impact**: No current disruption, but further lease payments paused until approval is obtained.  \n\n*Note: No capital markets or trading implications beyond governance compliance.*",
