  "summary": "- **Breakthrough in exosome-based cancer therapy**: INOVIQ's CAR-exosomes demonstrated 88% cell death in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and lung cancer cells in lab tests.  \n- **Potential advantages**: Faster production, safer use, and potentially more effective than traditional CAR-T cell therapies, with potential for \"off-the-shelf\" application.  \n- **Next steps**: Animal testing planned as a precursor to human clinical trials.  \n- **Validation of platform**: Successful lab results support the therapeutic platform's potential in treating solid tumors.  \n\n*No capital markets or liquidity-impacting information identified (no financing, timelines, or commercial milestones affecting valuation directly).*",
