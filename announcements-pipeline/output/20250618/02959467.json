  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (Prodigy Gold NL - ASX: PRX - 18 June 2025)**  \n\n#### **Metallurgical Testwork Results (Hyperion Gold Deposit)**  \n- **Oxide & Transition Material**:  \n  - **95%+ gold recovery** using standard Gravity Gold/Carbon-in-Leach (GG/CIL) processing.  \n- **Fresh Material**:  \n  - **Refractory component identified** (arsenopyrite association); initial recovery **<70%** with CIL alone.  \n  - **Flotation + CIL improves recovery to 91.2%** (5.8% gravity, 60.4% flotation, 25.0% cyanide leach of tails).  \n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Further testwork planned (heap leach potential, fine grinding, oxidative leaching).  \n  - Additional drilling (2025 field season) to expand resource, including govt.-funded diamond holes targeting high-grade Tethys lode (10m @ 15.9g/t Au).  \n\n#### **Mineral Resource Context**  \n- **Hyperion Resource (April 2025)**: **9.66Mt @ 1.4g/t Au (435koz)** (cut-off: 0.5g/t Oxide/Transition, 0.6g/t Fresh).  \n- **Prodigy Gold Total Resources**: **21.7Mt @ 1.4g/t Au (989koz)**.  \n\n#### **Permitting & Development**  \n- **Mineral Lease Application** submitted (Dec 2024); approval expected in ~2 years.  \n\n**Key Implications**: Enhanced metallurgical recoveries support economic viability, particularly for Fresh material, with potential to upgrade resource confidence and project valuation. Drilling and permitting progress underscores near-term catalyst potential.  \n\n*(Omitted: Routine operational details, director commentary, non-material JORC compliance notes.)*",
