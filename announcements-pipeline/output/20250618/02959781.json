  "summary": "- **Takeover Panel Application**: Keybridge Capital (KBC) challenges Yowie Group's (YOW) off-market takeover bid, alleging the bid is designed to dilute Keybridge\u2019s stake in Yowie and circumvent takeover rules.  \n- **Bid Conditions**: Yowie\u2019s offer (1:1 share swap) includes:  \n  - 35% minimum acceptance condition.  \n  - Keybridge must no longer control Yowie (\"No Control Condition\").  \n- **Keybridge Claims**:  \n  - Bid is for \"collateral purpose\" to entrench Yowie\u2019s board ahead of a shareholder meeting.  \n  - Alleges market inefficiency and disclosure deficiencies in Yowie\u2019s bidder statement.  \n- **Orders Sought**: Keybridge requests interim halt on Yowie\u2019s share acquisitions and final orders for bid withdrawal and cost reimbursement.  \n\n*Note: No immediate trading impact; outcome depends on Panel decision.*",
