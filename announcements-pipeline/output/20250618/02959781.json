  "summary": "- **Material Information Summary:**  \n  - **Takeover Bid Details:** Yowie Group Ltd (YOW) announced an off-market takeover bid for Keybridge Capital Ltd (KBC), offering 1 Yowie share per Keybridge share (published in Bidder's Statement on 13 June 2025).  \n  - **Key Conditions:**  \n    - Minimum 35% acceptance by Keybridge shareholders (\"Minimum Acceptance Condition\").  \n    - Keybridge must no longer control Yowie (\"No Control Condition\") by the end of the Offer Period.  \n  - **Keybridge's Allegations:** Claims the bid is a tactic to dilute Keybridge\u2019s stake in Yowie below 50%, circumvent takeover laws, and entrench Yowie\u2019s board. Also cites disclosure deficiencies in Bidder\u2019s Statement.  \n  - **Relief Sought:** Keybridge requests Panel orders to block Yowie\u2019s bid, compel withdrawal, and seek cost reimbursement.  \n\n*Note: No Panel decision or proceedings confirmed yet.*",
