  "summary": "### Material Information Extraction:  \n**Announcement Type: Exploration Results (Copper-Gold-Cobalt Mineralisation)**  \n\n#### Key Highlights:  \n- **New Mineralisation Discovered**: Significant Cu-Au-Co intercepts outside current resource boundaries at GAM (Great Australia Mine):  \n  - **Copperhead Corridor**:  \n    - 14m @ 0.81% Cu, 0.12g/t Au, 749ppm Co (CHRC001) including **6m @ 1.37% Cu**.  \n    - 11m @ 0.45% Cu, 0.08g/t Au, 171ppm Co (CHRC005).  \n    - Extends mineralisation **350m beyond known resource**.  \n  - **Coppermine Creek**: First-ever drill intercept (12m @ 0.65% Cu, 0.16g/t Au).  \n  - **Paddock Lode South**: 6m @ 0.63% Cu (70\u2013100m southwest of current resource).  \n  - **Orphan Shear**: High-grade oxidised copper (9m @ 0.83% Cu, 521ppm Co).  \n\n#### Implications:  \n- **Resource Expansion Potential**: Confirms continuity of mineralisation, enabling future resource upgrades.  \n- **Exploration Strategy**: Follow-up drilling planned at Copperhead, Coppermine Creek, and Orphan Shear.  \n\n#### Next Steps:  \n- Downhole EM surveys and 3D IP remodelling to refine targets.  \n- Resource definition drilling at Copperhead and Paddock South.  \n\n**Appendix 1 (JORC Table 1)**: Confirms standard sampling/QAQC protocols. No material deviations noted.  \n\n**Valuation Impact**: Positive for near-term resource growth and mine life extension.  \n\n---  \n**Rules Applied**: Omitted operational/technical details (e.g., drilling methods, JORC boilerplate). Focused on intercepts, scale, and strategic implications.",
