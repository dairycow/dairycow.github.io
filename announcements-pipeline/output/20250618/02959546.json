  "summary": "### Summary of Material Information:  \n- **Clinical Trial Results**: SCENESSE\u00ae (afamelanotide) **failed** to demonstrate repigmentation as a **monotherapy** in vitiligo patients (Phase II study CUV104).  \n- **Key Implication**: Confirms need for **adjunct NB-UVB phototherapy** for efficacy. Ongoing Phase III studies (CUV105, CUV107) will focus on combination therapy.  \n- **Regulatory Impact**: Data addresses regulator queries but rules out monotherapy pathway. Results will support future marketing authorization submissions.  \n\nNo capital markets or trading-specific actions disclosed.",
