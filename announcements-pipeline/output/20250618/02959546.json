  "summary": "**Announcement Type: Clinical Trial Results**  \n\n- **Key Outcome**: SCENESSE\u00ae (afamelanotide) **monotherapy failed** to demonstrate repigmentation in vitiligo patients in Phase II study (CUV104).  \n- **Strategic Shift**: Future trials (CUV105, CUV107) will focus on **SCENESSE\u00ae + NB-UVB phototherapy**, aligning with clinical evidence that combined therapy is required for efficacy.  \n- **Regulatory Impact**: Data from CUV104 will be included in future regulatory submissions for vitiligo treatment approval.  \n\n**No immediate capital markets impact identified** (no funding, timelines, or material financial changes disclosed).",
