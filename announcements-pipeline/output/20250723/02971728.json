  "summary": "### **AdAlta Limited (ASX:1AD) \u2013 Quarterly Report (Appendix 4C) Summary**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights**  \n- **Prioritized CAR-T Products for Licensing**: Two CAR-T therapies (solid cancers) advanced for definitive agreements\u2014armored CAR-T (lung/mesothelioma/ovarian/pancreatic/colorectal cancers) and novel-target CAR-T (colorectal/lung/gastric cancers).  \n [*Note: Potential catalysts; partnering could unlock value.*]  \n\n- **Capital Raise**:  \n  - **Entitlement Offer**: Raised **$1.3M** (before costs) at **$0.003/share** (proceeds for partnering/strategic options).  \n  - **Issued**: 428.1M shares + 227M options (exercise: $0.01, expiry: Jun-2028).  \n\n- **Cash Position**: **$1.31M** (vs. $0.83M last quarter). **Estimated runway**: 1.7 quarters (per Item 8.5).  \n  - *Cash burn mitigation*: Staff reductions, suspended director/CEO fees, equipment sales ($0.1M).  \n\n- **Other Updates**:  \n  - AD-214 (anti-fibrotic drug): Active licensing discussions (new inquiries at BIO25).  \n  - Board change: Non-exec director Iain Ross resigned (conflict of interest).  \n\n---  \n**Assessment**: Tight liquidity (~2Q runway), but strategic focus on high-potential CAR-T deals and cost controls may attract speculative interest. Monitor licensing progress (key near-term catalyst).  \n\n*(Omitted: Operational minutiae, management quotes, non-material R&D details.)*",
