  "summary": "Here\u2019s the material information extracted from the ASX announcement for trading and capital markets decisions:\n\n### **Exploration Update (Storm Copper Project, Canada)**  \n- **Key Discoveries**:  \n  - **8km copper gossan strike** identified along fault network, with visual chalcocite (high-grade copper sulphide) and malachite confirmed by portable XRF.  \n  - **Diamond drilling**:  \n    - **PFS-001**: 43m combined visual chalcocite/chalcopyrite, including semi-massive sulphides.  \n    - **PFS-002**: 49.5m combined visual chalcocite/chalcopyrite, including semi-massive sulphides.  \n  - **RC drilling**: 21 holes completed (3,194m), targeting resource upgrades and exploration (Thunder, Lightning Ridge, Cirrus, Cyclone, Corona).  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - **Assays pending**: Expected in **6\u20138 weeks** for all visual mineralisation.  \n  - **RC drilling continues** at Tornado area for near-surface resource potential.  \n  - **Diamond drilling** underway at Cirrus Deeps target.  \n\n- **Potential Impact**:  \n  - Thick sulphide intersections **outside current resource envelope** suggest **resource growth potential**, particularly at Cyclone Deposit.  \n  - High-grade visuals (unassayed) could **elevate project economics** if lab results confirm grades.  \n\n### **Material Considerations**:  \n- **Caution**: Visual estimates are not lab-confirmed; assays required for economic valuation.  \n- **Catalysts**: Assay results (expected late Q3 2025) and further drilling updates.  \n\n**No capital raising, financials, or operational cash balance disclosed**. Focus is on exploration results with potential to impact resource size and project viability.  \n\n*Format: Bullet points limited to trading-relevant data; operational/background details omitted.*",
