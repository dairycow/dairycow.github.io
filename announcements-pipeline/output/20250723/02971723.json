  "summary": "### Key Material Information:  \n- **Preclinical Data Update**:  \n  - HMBD-002 combined with **radiotherapy** showed improved efficacy in mouse models of **squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)**, increasing median survival to **35.5 days vs. 27 days** (radiotherapy alone).  \n  - Potential **new clinical pathway** for HMBD-002 as a VISTA inhibitor to enhance radiotherapy efficacy in SCCHN, breast cancer, and melanoma.  \n\n- **Development Implications**:  \n  - Data supports **future clinical trials** combining HMBD-002 with radiotherapy, but no definitive decision yet. Target timeline for next trials: **CY2026**.  \n\n*No capital markets or trading-specific actions identified.*",
