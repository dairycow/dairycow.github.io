  "summary": "This document is a Climate-Related Disclosures (CRD) report from Turners Automotive Group Limited (TAG) for FY25 (ended 31 March 2025). Below is a concise summary of material information relevant for trading or capital markets decisions:\n\n### **Key Highlights from the Report:**\n\n1. **Emissions Metrics (Material for ESG Investors):**\n   - **Scope 1 (Direct Emissions):** 294 tCO\u2082e (primarily from company fleet fuel use). \n   - **Scope 2 (Indirect Emissions \u2013 Electricity):** 1,242 tCO\u2082e (location-based).\n   - **Scope 3 (Value Chain Emissions):** 514,306 tCO\u2082e (dominated by *Category 11: Use of sold products*\u201496% of Scope 3 emissions from vehicle lifetime fuel use).\n     - *Note:* Scope 3 emissions are not assured and subject to estimation uncertainty.\n\n2. **Fleet Transition Progress:**\n   - 74% of TAG\u2019s company fleet now consists of Low Emission Vehicles (LEVs), up from 70% in FY24.\n   - $1.8M spent in FY25 on hybrid fleet vehicles (91 vehicles, 89 replacing ICE vehicles).\n\n3. **Climate Targets:**  \n   - **First-time vehicle imports:** Achieved 82% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions vs. FY19 baseline (3,499 tCO\u2082e in FY25 vs. 19,000 tCO\u2082e in FY19).  \n   - **Operational emissions (Scope 1+2):** 5.3% reduction vs. FY23 (falling short of 20% target due to delayed fleet transition impact).  \n\n4. **Material Risks & Opportunities:**  \n   - **Physical Risks:** Minor FY25 impacts ($35k storm damage to a site, largely insured).  \n   - **Transition Risks:** Policy shifts (e.g., ICE bans), carbon pricing, and consumer preference for EVs.  \n   - **Opportunities:** Growth in used EV sales, end-of-life vehicle recycling.  \n\n5. **Governance:**  \n   - Climate oversight by Board and ARMS Committee. No direct link between climate metrics and executive remuneration.  \n\n6. **Assurance:**  \n   - Limited assurance provided by Baker Tilly Staples Rodway for **Scope 1 and 2 emissions only** (not Scope 3).  \n\n### **Capital Markets Implications:**\n- **No capital raising or material capex** related to climate initiatives beyond fleet transition (~$1.8M in FY25).  \n- **Scope 3 emissions risk exposure** is significant (96% tied to sold vehicles\u2019 lifetime fuel use), but TAG has limited control over this.  \n- **Operational resilience** to physical climate risks appears manageable (minor insured losses).  \n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe report underscores TAG\u2019s progress in fleet decarbonization but highlights **Scope 3 emissions as a structural challenge** linked to New Zealand\u2019s auto fleet transition. No immediate financial or liquidity impacts identified.  \n\n**Actionable Takeaway:**  \nInvestors focused on ESG may note the high Scope 3 emissions and lack of near-term science-based targets but acknowledge TAG\u2019s alignment with NZ\u2019s broader automotive sector transition.",
