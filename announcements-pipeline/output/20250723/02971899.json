  "summary": "**Summary of ASX Climate Disclosure Announcement for Turners Automotive Group (TAG):**  \n\n### **Key Material Information**  \n1. **Financial Impacts (FY25):**  \n   - **Operational Emissions Reduction:** Achieved 5.3% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 emissions (vs. target of 20%).  \n   - **Fleet Transition:** 74% of company fleet now low-emission vehicles (LEVs); **$1.8M** spent in FY25 on 91 hybrid vehicles.  \n   - **Physical Climate Costs:** Minor storm damage ($35K, insured) and resilience upgrades ($38K).  \n\n2. **Scope 3 Emissions:**  \n   - **96%** from \"use of sold products\" (vehicle lifetime emissions).  \n   - Local sourcing (97% of vehicles from NZ market) ties emissions to national fleet transition.  \n\n3. **Targets (FY25 Performance):**  \n   - **First-time Import Emissions:** 3,499t CO2 (16% increase YoY but 82% reduction since FY19).  \n   - **Financed Vehicle Emissions:** 17% reduction per vehicle (vs. FY19 baseline).  \n\n4. **Scenario Analysis:**  \n   - Assessed **Orderly** (1.4\u00b0C), **Disorderly** (1.8\u00b0C), and **Hot House** (3\u00b0C+) scenarios.  \n   - Key risks: Business disruption from floods, supply chain delays, regulatory shifts (e.g., ICE bans).  \n\n5. **Transition Plan:**  \n   - Focus on incremental fleet electrification and property resilience. No major capex beyond fleet upgrades.  \n   - Scope 3 target reassessment planned for FY26.  \n\n**No material trading or capital-raising information identified.**  \n*(Note: This is a climate disclosure, not a trading halt or capital markets event.)*  \n\n**Rationale for Materiality:**  \n- Emissions data and fleet transition impact long-term valuation (regulatory/consumer pressures).  \n- Targets and scenario analysis inform strategic resilience but lack immediate financial triggers.",
