  "summary": "**Material Information Summary**\n\n### **Climate-Related Disclosures (Non-Financial)**  \n- **Physical Climate Impacts (FY25):**  \n  - Storm damage at North Island branch: ~$35k (mostly insured).  \n  - Roof/gutter resilience upgrades: $38k at another branch.  \n  - Both impacts deemed immaterial.  \n\n- **Transition Efforts:**  \n  - Continued transition to Low Emission Vehicles (LEVs):  \n    - FY25 investment: **$1.8M** for **91 hybrid vehicles** (74% of fleet by Mar-2025).  \n\n- **Scope 1 & 2 Emissions (Assured):**  \n  - **Scope 1 (Direct):** Primarily fleet fuel use.  \n  - **Scope 2 (Indirect):** Purchased electricity (location-based method). Solar installed at 2 sites.  \n  - **Reduction Target:** Achieved **5.3% reduction** in Scope 1+2 emissions vs. FY23 (below 20% target).  \n\n- **Scope 3 Emissions (Unassured):**  \n  - **96% from Category 11 (Use of Sold Products)** \u2013 lifetime emissions of vehicles sold.  \n  - **Other material categories:** Purchased goods/services, capital goods, end-of-life disposal, investments.  \n\n- **Targets (FY25 Progress):**  \n  - **First-time import vehicle emissions:** 3,499t CO2 (~82% reduction since FY19 base year).  \n  - **Financed vehicle emissions:** 17% reduction vs. FY19 (missed 25% target).  \n  - **LEV fleet:** 74% LEVs by Mar-2025 (target: 50%).  \n\n- **Governance:**  \n  - Climate risks/scenarios reviewed by Board and Audit Committee.  \n  - No direct link between climate metrics and executive remuneration.  \n\n- **Key Scenario Risks:**  \n  - **Orderly Transition (Net Zero 2050):** High transition risk (EV shift).  \n  - **Disorderly/Delayed Transition:** Physical risks (e.g., site closures from extreme weather).  \n  - **Hot House (3\u00b0C+):** High physical risks (e.g., insurance unaffordability).  \n\n---  \n**No capital raising, trading halt, or material financial disclosures identified.**  \n**Focus:** Operational emissions, fleet transition, and regulatory compliance.",
