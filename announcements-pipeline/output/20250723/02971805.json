  "summary": "### Key Material Information:  \n- **Drill Results**:  \n  - **GHHHRCD0054 (Diamond Drill Hole)**:  \n    - 4.4m @ 9.3 g/t Au from 339m (including 1.9m @ 20.7 g/t Au from 340m).  \n    - Deepest hole drilled at Hopes Hill, confirming underground potential.  \n  - **GHHHRC0059 (RC Drill Hole)**:  \n    - 30.0m @ 2.2 g/t Au from 157m (including 10.0m @ 4.7 g/t Au from 177m).  \n- **Exploration Upside**:  \n  - High-grade intercepts extend mineralisation over 850m plunge, open in all directions.  \n  - Potential for extensions beyond historic pit, with targets identified for future drilling.  \n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Pending DHEM (down-hole electromagnetic) survey results expected in coming weeks.  \n  - Additional diamond drilling planned to test deeper targets.  \n\n**Summary**: High-grade gold intercepts validate deeper exploration potential at Hopes Hill, with further results pending. No capital or liquidity impacts disclosed.",
