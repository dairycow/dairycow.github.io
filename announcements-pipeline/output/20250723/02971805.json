  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Exploration Results:**  \n  - **High-grade intercepts at Hopes Hill Project:**  \n    - **GHHHRCD0054 (Diamond Drill Hole):** 4.4m @ 9.3 g/t Au (including 1.9m @ 20.7 g/t Au from 340m), extending mineralization 300m below surface.  \n    - **GHHHRC0059 (RC Drill Hole):** 30.0m @ 2.2 g/t Au (including 10.0m @ 4.7 g/t Au from 177m), confirming continuity of mineralization.  \n  - **Significance:** Deepest drill hole to date at Hopes Hill, opening new underground mining potential. Mineralization remains open in all directions.  \n\n- **Upcoming Catalysts:**  \n  - Down-hole electromagnetic (DHEM) survey results expected in coming weeks.  \n  - Additional diamond drilling planned to test deeper targets.  \n\n- **Operational Update:**  \n  - Second RC drill rig considered to accelerate shallow drilling.  \n\n*No material capital markets activity (e.g., raising, M&A) disclosed.*",
