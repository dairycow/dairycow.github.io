  "summary": "- **Exploration Update**:  \n  - Diamond drilling commenced at Hulk sedimentary target (Rae Copper Project, Nunavut).  \n  - First three drill holes target high-potential areas near historic intercepts (e.g., 29m at 0.57% Cu from 197m).  \n  - RC drilling to resume at Danvers prospect, where previous assays included 175m @ 2.5% Cu & 8.66g/t Ag.  \n  - Drone-based magnetotellurics survey planned to refine targeting.  \n\n- **Funding**:  \n  - Company \"well funded\" after recent A$14.4m capital raise (implied capacity to accelerate exploration).  \n\n- **Catalyst**:  \n  - Results from drilling and geophysics could materially impact valuation if they confirm resource potential or expand known mineralization.  \n\n*No material trading/capital markets actions (e.g., raising, halt) identified.*",
