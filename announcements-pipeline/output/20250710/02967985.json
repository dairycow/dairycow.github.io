  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (ASX: WCN \u2013 Diamond Drilling Commences at Rae Copper Project)**  \n\n- **Exploration Update**:  \n  - Diamond drilling has commenced at the **Hulk sedimentary target** (100% owned by WCN), focused on a large untested geophysical anomaly.  \n  - Three initial drill holes target distinct zones:  \n    - **HLK25001**: Eastern margin near historic intercept (29m at 0.57% Cu).  \n    - **HLK25002**: Western margin near Herb Dixon Fault (potential fluid conduit).  \n    - **HLK25003**: Footwall of Herb Dixon Fault.  \n  - RC drilling to resume at **Danvers prospect**, where prior results included high-grade intercepts (e.g., 175m at 2.5% Cu & 8.66g/t Ag).  \n  - **Drone MT survey** underway to refine targeting at Danvers.  \n\n- **Funding**:  \n  - Company is **fully funded** for expanded exploration after raising **A$14.4M** (capital raise details not specified in announcement).  \n\n- **Catalysts**:  \n  - **Canadian government support**: Increased funding for critical minerals (copper, nickel, etc.) may benefit junior explorers like WCN.  \n\n- **Historic Context**:  \n  - Rae Project hosts a **non-JORC historic resource** of 4.16Mt at 2.96% Cu (acquired Nov 2024; 1% NSR retained by seller).  \n\n**No material trading/capital markets triggers identified** (e.g., new capital raising, resource upgrade, or financial results). Focus is operational progress.  \n\n*Note: Omitted non-material details (e.g., camp photos, regional geology, JORC tables).*",
