  "summary": "**Key Material Information:**  \n\n- **Retraction of In-Ground Value Statement**: Centaurus Metals retracted a prior statement in its 8 July 2025 presentation claiming the Jaguar Project's mineral resource held \"over US$14 billion in-ground value.\" The retraction cites non-compliance with JORC 2012 (Clause 51) due to insufficient basis for the valuation. Investors are advised not to rely on this figure.  \n- **Amended Announcement Attached**: The reference to in-ground value has been removed from the updated presentation.  \n\n*No other material trading or capital markets information identified.*",
