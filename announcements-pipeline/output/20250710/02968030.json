  "summary": "- **Takeover Offer Price Increase**: Kinterra raises offer price to **A$0.063 per share** (from A$0.062), representing a **125% premium** to NWR's last closing price (A$0.028 on 20 May 2025).  \n- **Potential Further Increase to A$0.064/share**: If Kinterra\u2019s stake exceeds **30% by 11 July 2025 (7pm AEST)**, the offer becomes **unconditional**, with faster payment terms (within 10 business days post-acceptance).  \n- **Funding Superiority**: Kinterra has **binding capital commitments** vs. CAML\u2019s lack of binding funding agreements for its competing offer (A$0.062/share).  \n- **Interim Loan Facility**: Kinterra offers **US$6.5M unsecured loan** to NWR (same terms as CAML\u2019s proposal), but **without** the 50% control precondition.  \n\n*Excluded routine details on option cancellations, on-market purchases, and director approvals.*",
