  "summary": "**Material Information Summary (ASX:PGO - Exploration Update)**  \n\n- **Key Geophysical Findings**:  \n  - Extensive high-intensity IP chargeability anomaly identified at White Lion Prospect, coinciding with a bullseye magnetic anomaly (analogous to 5Moz Mt Leyshon gold deposit).  \n  - Target area spans **1.5km x 1.0km**, with resistivity anomalies linked to gold-bearing structures.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Heritage clearance underway; **drilling planned for Q4 2025**.  \n  - Additional Pole-Dipole IP survey (completion by July 2025) to refine target depths.  \n\n- **Project Context**:  \n  - Located 500m south of Alice River Fault Zone, with historical surface gold mineralization.  \n  - **No prior drilling** in the immediate target area.  \n\n*No capital markets or liquidity impacts; operational focus only.*",
