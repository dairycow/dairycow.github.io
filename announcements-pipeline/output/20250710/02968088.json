  "summary": "- **Drilling commenced at North Cobar Copper-Gold Project (NSW):**  \n  - 4,000m RC drill program targeting Cobar-type geophysical anomalies.  \n  - Targets located at intersections of prospective regional fault systems.  \n  - Expected completion in 4-6 weeks.  \n\n- **Exploration context:**  \n  - Project is underexplored, adjacent to MAC\u2019s CSA Copper-Gold Mine (recently acquired for US$1.03B).  \n  - Coincident gravity, magnetic, and IP anomalies suggest potential for copper-gold sulphide mineralisation.  \n\n- **No material financial or capital markets impact disclosed** (e.g., no fundraising, resource estimates, or assay results).  \n\n**Summary:** Operational update with no immediate trading/capital markets implications. Monitor for drill results.",
