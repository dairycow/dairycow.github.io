  "summary": "### Key Material Information:  \n\n- **Extended Reconnaissance Programme**: 24-hole hand auger drill programme initiated at Central Rutile Project to assess potential mineralisation continuity from Peak Minerals' adjacent Afanloum licence.  \n- **Geological Upside**: DY6 anticipates similar high-grade rutile mineralisation on its Nsimbo and Alamba licences, given shared geological units with Peak Minerals' discovery (e.g., 7m @ 5.1% HM).  \n- **Recent Expansion**: Central Rutile Project enlarged to **4,974km\u00b2** (from 2,140km\u00b2) via Weaver licences acquisition (8 July 2025).  \n\n**Rationale**: Focused on near-term exploration catalysts and project scalability, with immediate drilling targeting potential resource extension. Excluded operational/non-impactful details.",
