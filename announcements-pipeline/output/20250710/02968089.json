  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n- **Metallurgical Testwork Results:**  \n  - Successful 3-month resin mini-pilot study completed with improved recovery rates for uranium, base metals (Ni, Co, Cu, Zn), and rare earth elements (REE) versus 2022 DFS.  \n  - **Uranium recovery:** 85% overall (92% post-beneficiation).  \n  - **Critical minerals recovery:** Ni (50%), Co (50%), Cu (77%), Zn (89%), REE (50%).  \n  - **Key breakthrough:** Saline water can be used in processing, reducing costs and environmental impact.  \n\n- **Project Economics & DFS Update:**  \n  - Revised **DFS underway**, targeting completion in **Q3 2026** with updated process flowsheet and Ore Reserve Estimate.  \n  - **Critical minerals revenue** to offset uranium operating costs, expected to be **material**.  \n  - **Target production:** ~3.5 Mlb U3O8/year (85% recovery), requiring ~2.8 Mtpa ROM ore feed.  \n  - **Stripping ratio assumption:** 10:1 for revised mining plan.  \n\n- **Resource Base:**  \n  - **Mulga Rock Project total resources:** 115.1 Mt @ 420 ppm U3O8 (104.8 Mlb U3O8).  \n  - **Ambassador Deposit (MRP East):** 71.2 Mlb U3O8 (93% of MRP East resource).  \n\n- **No capital raising, trading halt, or liquidity events announced.**  \n\n**Focus:** Results support potential upside in revised DFS, emphasizing cost efficiencies and byproduct credits. Market impact hinges on DFS outcomes.",
