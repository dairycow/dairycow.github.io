  "summary": "- **Board recommends voting AGAINST all EGM resolutions** proposed by requisitioning shareholders (Martin Hosking, Richard Cawsey et al.).  \n- **EGM seeks full Board replacement** with 4 new directors; current Board views this as disruptive amid ongoing leadership renewal (recent CEO/Chair appointments) and stabilising operations.  \n- **FY25 guidance reaffirmed**; strategic review of capital structure and portfolio positioning underway. Results due 14 August 2025.  \n- **Key concern**: Requisitioning shareholders (16% ownership) provided no alternative strategy; EGM deemed costly and unnecessary ahead of scheduled AGM.  \n\n**No material financial/trading impact disclosed**. Focus is governance contention.",
