  "summary": "- **EGM Opposition**: Articore Board recommends shareholders vote AGAINST all resolutions proposed by Requisitioning Shareholders (Hosking/Cawsey group) to replace the entire Board.  \n- **Timing Dispute**: Board deems EGM unnecessary and disruptive, citing proximity to AGM and lack of strategic justification from requisioners.  \n- **Governance Changes**: Recent Board renewal includes US-based leadership (Chair Robin Mendelson, CEO Vivek Kumar) to align with 90% international revenue base.  \n- **Strategic Progress**: FY25 guidance reaffirmed; strategic review underway; interim CFO appointed.  \n- **EGM Likely Proceeding**: Requisitioning Shareholders (16% ownership) rejected compromise talks, forcing EGM under Corporations Act.  \n\n*No material financial or trading-specific data disclosed.*",
