  "summary": "**Material Information Summary:**\n\n- **Exploration Results at Ularring Project (Chatham Target):**  \n  - Maiden soil program identified a **1.3km x 0.45km Au-Cu soil anomaly** (max values: **78ppb Au**, **1,126ppm Cu**) with associated Ag, Te, and W.  \n  - Coincides with a **VTEM geophysical anomaly**, suggesting potential sulphide-rich mineralization at depth.  \n  - Located on the **Meenar Shear Corridor**, a prospective regional structure.  \n  - **No prior systematic drilling** in the area; further infill sampling and drilling planned.  \n\n- **Diamond Drilling (Centre Forest Prospect):**  \n  - **CFDD002 intersection**:  \n    - **7.88m @ 0.17g/t Au, 0.12% Cu** (463m depth).  \n    - **1.21m @ 0.18g/t Au, 0.29% Cu** (477.75m depth).  \n  - Priority shifted from Centre Forest to Chatham due to higher exploration potential.  \n\n- **Capital Raising Update (Section 708AA Notice):**  \n  - **Entitlement Offer** (1:3 ratio at **$0.12/share**) to raise **~$2.52M** (pre-costs).  \n  - No material changes to disclosure since **23 May 2025** notice.  \n  - Potential dilution for non-participating shareholders; shortfall allocations capped at **19.9% voting power**.  \n\n**Omitted:** Operational details, JORC technical appendices, historical exploration summaries.",
