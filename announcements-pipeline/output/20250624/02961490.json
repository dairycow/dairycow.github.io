  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (Dividend Reinvestment Plan Information Booklet):  \n\n- **DRP Type**: Dividend and Distribution Reinvestment Plan (DRP) for Eildon Capital Limited and Eildon Capital Trust (stapled securities).  \n- **Eligibility**: Open to securityholders with registered addresses in Australia or New Zealand (Board discretion for other jurisdictions).  \n- **Participation**:  \n  - Voluntary; participants can elect full or partial reinvestment of dividends/distributions into additional stapled securities.  \n  - No brokerage or transaction costs for participants.  \n- **Pricing Mechanism**:  \n  - Stapled securities issued at **Market Price** (average VWAP over a 5+ Business Day \"Pricing Period\"), minus any Board-determined **discount**.  \n- **Tax Implications**: Reinvested distributions treated similarly to cash distributions (securityholders advised to seek tax advice).  \n- **Key Dates**: Not specified in booklet (typically announced per distribution).  \n- **Modification/Termination**: Board may alter, suspend, or terminate the DRP at any time.  \n\n**No material trading or capital-raising details identified** (e.g., no new capital raised, no timetable for specific distributions).  \n\n*Note: DRP mechanics are standard; material impact would arise only upon activation (e.g., discount percentage set for a specific distribution).*",
