  "summary": "Here\u2019s the concise material information extracted from the announcement:  \n\n### **Key Highlights**  \n- **Gold Production Restart**: Initiated transport of 850 tonnes of crushed Agate Creek material to the Georgetown Gold Processing Plant. Plans to cart 13,000+ tonnes from stockpiles in July 2025.  \n- **Exploration Targets**: Three new gold Exploration Targets identified (Red Dam, Electric Light, Big Reef), totaling **63,000\u2013265,000 oz Au** potential.  \n- **Mineral Resources**: Existing JORC-compliant gold resources of **590,000 oz** (Agate Creek: 370,000 oz at 1.38 g/t Au; Georgetown: 119,000 oz at 3.9 g/t Au). Updates planned for Q3 2025.  \n- **Ore Reserves Work**: Engaged consultant to assess Ore Reserves potential at Agate Creek; results expected Q3 2025.  \n- **Environmental Approvals**: Applications for tailings facility expansion and mining approvals on track, submissions within 3 months.  \n- **Leadership Appointments**: Hired experienced Operations Manager (Bob Hayes) and Exploration Manager (Pat Smith) to drive restart and resource growth.  \n\n### **Material Risks/Omissions**  \n- **Retracted Announcement**: Previous release (19 June 2025) on stockpile grades was retracted due to non-JORC compliance. Investors advised to disregard.  \n\n**Note**: Operational updates (e.g., plant maintenance, geotechnical studies) omitted as routine unless directly impacting near-term production or valuation.  \n\n*Format tailored for capital markets relevance; excludes non-material details.*",
