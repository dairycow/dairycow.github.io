  "summary": "**Summary of Material Information:**  \n\n- **Pilot Plant Progress:**  \n  - Construction on schedule and budget, commissioning expected July 2025.  \n  - First-of-its-kind photocatalytic water splitting (PWS) facility at University of Adelaide\u2019s Roseworthy Campus.  \n\n- **Key Technology Advantages:**  \n  - PWS eliminates need for electrolysers and reduces reliance on renewable electricity, potentially lowering production costs.  \n  - Modular, scalable system targeting hard-to-abate industries (~100Mtpa hydrogen market).  \n\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Testing reactor designs, photocatalysts, and validating commercial scalability post-commissioning.  \n\n*No material capital markets or trading-specific information (e.g., capital raising, liquidity events, or financial metrics) identified.*",
