  "summary": "### Key Material Information Extracted:  \n\n- **Price Query Response**:  \n  - Recent share price surge (from $0.068 to $0.24) attributed to:  \n    - Two new **US & UK contracts** (announced 16 & 18 June), though deemed non-price-sensitive due to small initial value.  \n    - Market speculation on long-term potential in defense/security sectors based on these contracts.  \n    - ~59% of traded volume (16\u201317 June) due to internal transfers by a large shareholder.  \n\n- **Potential Acquisition**:  \n  - **US-based data security assets** under due diligence ($16M USD max consideration).  \n  - Transaction **uncertain**; no binding agreement yet.  \n  - Strategic rationale: Accelerates US expansion, adds recurring revenue, and creates synergies.  \n  - Possible funding mix: Existing cash, customer contracts, capital raising (up to $25M AUD), or debt.  \n\n- **ASX Suspension**:  \n  - Trading halted pending clarity on potential acquisition confidentiality.  \n\n### Note:  \nNo confirmation of capital raising or definitive acquisition terms at this stage.",
