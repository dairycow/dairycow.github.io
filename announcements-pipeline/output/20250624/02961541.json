  "summary": "This appears to be a product catalogue/document for CitiFirst MINIs (structured equity derivative products) rather than a market-moving ASX announcement. \n\nKey takeaways:\n- Lists leveraged long/short single-stock MINIs on ASX-listed securities  \n- Shows Australian/international index MINIs, currency MINIs and commodity MINIs  \n- Details strike prices, stop-loss triggers, gearing levels and indicative valuations  \n- Effective date of 25-Jun-25 for all products  \n\nNo material trading or capital markets information identified - this is a standard product offerings document. Would not typically trigger trading decisions or impact valuations directly.  \n\nFor ECM purposes, note this doesn't contain announcements on:\n- Capital raisings  \n- Trading halts  \n- Financial results  \n- Material corporate actions  \n\nRecommend focusing ASX announcement reviews on actual company releases flagged with proper announcement types (e.g. Appendix 3B, 4C etc).",
