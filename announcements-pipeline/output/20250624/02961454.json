  "summary": "- **HBV Drug Development Update**:  \n  - First stage of preclinical animal safety study completed successfully (no toxicity observed at tested doses).  \n  - Next stage (efficacy testing in two HBV mouse models) underway to evaluate antiviral activity in early and late infection stages.  \n  - Study conducted at SCRIPPS Research Institute (USA).  \n\n- **Commercial Progress**:  \n  - Ongoing commercialization talks via C14 Consulting Group, including discussions at BIO2025 conference (focused on HIV-1 program).  \n\n- **Background**:  \n  - HBV chronic infection affects ~250 million globally; Biotron\u2019s compounds target cccDNA reduction (key to viral eradication).  \n  - Recent capital raised (rights issue) allocated to HBV preclinical advancement.  \n\n*Note: No immediate trading or capital structure impact identified; update primarily developmental.*",
