  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Exploration Results:**  \n  - **Extension of Sunnyside gold system by 1.6km**, now totaling ~2km strike length.  \n  - **Peak gold results**:  \n    - **1,580ppb Au in soils** (vs. 476ppb at Sunnyside Prospect).  \n    - **17.55g/t Au and 11.85g/t Au in rock chips** from historical workings.  \n  - **Untested potential**: Extension area has limited historical drilling.  \n\n- **Forward Program:**  \n  - **Pending assays** for holes 25ENDD007\u2013010 (expected Q3 2025).  \n  - **+10,000m follow-up drilling planned** to test continuity and extensions.  \n  - **Additional soil sampling** to close off anomalies.  \n\n- **Capital Structure (as stated):**  \n  - **Cash balance**: $10.35M (as at 31/03/2025 + 22/05/2025 capital raising).  \n  - **Shares outstanding**: 1,025M.  \n\n**No material capital markets actions (e.g., raising, halt) identified.**  \n\n*Note: Focused on high-grade assays, extension potential, and forward work\u2014key for valuation/resource growth.*",
