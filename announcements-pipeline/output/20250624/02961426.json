  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:\n\n- **Visible Gold Discovery**: First drillhole (BO-25-27) at Paquin prospect intersects **visible gold** in a 9m zone (183-192m) with smoky quartz veins, sulphides (5-7% arsenopyrite-pyrite-pyrrhotite), and strong alteration.  \n- **Historical Context**: Paquin prospect has prior high-grade intercepts (e.g., **9m @ 16.96g/t Au**). Located on Quebec\u2019s Cadillac Break, a prolific gold belt (>110Moz Au produced).  \n- **Assays Pending**: Results expected by **mid-July 2025** \u2013 critical for validation.  \n- **Drill Program**: Ongoing, with 3 additional holes planned to test western extension of mineralisation.  \n\n*Note: Visual gold observations are preliminary; assays required for economic assessment.*  \n\n---  \n**Announcement Type**: Exploration Update (Material: Potential resource expansion).  \n**Next Catalyst**: Assay results (mid-July).",
