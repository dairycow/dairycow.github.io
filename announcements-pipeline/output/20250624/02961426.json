Located on the Cadillac Break, a gold-endowed structure.  \n  - **Assays Pending**: Results expected by **mid-July 2025**.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Priority logging/sampling of BO-25-27.  \n  - Three additional holes planned to test western extension of mineralisation.  \n\n**Caution**: Visual estimates are not definitive; assay results required for economic assessment.  \n\n*No material capital markets or trading-specific information (e.g., raising, halt, liquidity event) identified.*",
