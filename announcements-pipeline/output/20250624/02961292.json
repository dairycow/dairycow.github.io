  "summary": "Since you haven't provided the actual ASX announcement PDF for review, I cannot extract or summarize specific material information. However, here\u2019s how I would format the summary based on common announcement types:  \n\n- **Trading Halt Request**: \"Pending release of announcement regarding [specify reason, e.g., capital raising, material transaction].\"  \n- **Capital Raising**: \"Placement to raise $X AUD; SPP capped at $Y AUD. Ex-date: [date], Record date: [date], Close date: [date].\"  \n- **Quarterly (4C)**: \"Cash balance: $X AUD; Key highlights: [e.g., revenue $Y, production Z units].\"  \n- **Other Material Announcement**: \"[Critical detail 1], [Critical detail 2] \u2013 e.g., major contract signed, asset sale, or regulatory approval.\"  \n\nIf you share the PDF (or key details from it), I can provide a tailored summary. For now: **No material information identified**.",
