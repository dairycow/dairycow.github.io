  "summary": "**Material Information Summary**  \n\n- **Hyperaccumulator Confirmation**: Sesuvium portulacastrum seaweed confirmed as a hyperaccumulator of gold (up to 81.32 mg/kg dry biomass), silver, copper, and lithium.  \n- **Polluted Water Enhancement**: Metal uptake significantly higher in polluted/brackish water vs. clean marine environments.  \n- **Extraction Challenge**: Conventional chemical extraction methods failed due to multi-metal interference; focus shifts to *biological (microbial)* techniques.  \n- **Next Phase**: Six-month R&D program under negotiation with TPIH to develop selective microbial extraction processes.  \n- **Scalability**: Species\u2019 adaptability supports potential deployment in diverse coastal regions (e.g., Indonesian archipelago).  \n\n*No capital markets or trading-specific actions announced.*",
