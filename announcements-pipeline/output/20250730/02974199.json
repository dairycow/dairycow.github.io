  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n(Exploration Results Announcement)  \n\n**Key Highlights:**  \n- **High-grade iron assays** from rock chip sampling at Camp Creek Project (100%-owned):  \n  - **10 samples >60% Fe**, with **peak grade of 67.91% Fe** (low impurities).  \n  - Results validate historical targets and confirm iron enrichment potential.  \n- **Proximity advantage**: Near CuFe\u2019s 50%-owned Yarram Iron Ore Project (12.7Mt @ 55.4% Fe resource).  \n- **Next steps**: Further fieldwork (mapping, sampling) to define targets for future drilling.  \n\n**Cautionary Notes:**  \n- Early-stage exploration; results not indicative of economic viability.  \n- Historical assay data (2014\u20132018) cited but not independently verified by CuFe.  \n\n**No material capital, liquidity, or valuation impacts disclosed.**  \n\n*(Omitted: Geological details, historical data tables, JORC codes, and non-material operational updates.)*",
