  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (Zelira Therapeutics \u2013 Q4 FY2025 Quarterly Report)**  \n\n**Clinical/Operational Highlights:**  \n- **ZLT-L-007 Diabetic Neuropathy Study**: Demonstrated superior efficacy versus Lyrica\u00ae in pain reduction, sleep improvement, and symptom relief. Data supports progression to FDA trials.  \n- **HOPE\u00ae 1 SPV Funding**: Converted US$3.25M (+$326k interest) of debt into equity, strengthening SPV capital structure for ASD clinical trials.  \n- **Post-Quarter R&D Loan**: Secured non-dilutive $650k facility (Rocking Horse Capital) against FY25 R&D tax rebate.  \n\n**Financial Snapshot (Appendix 4C):**  \n- **Cash Used in Operations (Q4)**: $384k.  \n- **Closing Cash Balance (30 June 2025)**: $7k.  \n- **Funding Outlook**:  \n  - ATF facility ($1M standby equity) and ongoing HOPE\u00ae SPV fundraising (~US$32M target).  \n  - Warns insufficient liquidity (<2 quarters) but cites secured loans/SPV pipeline as mitigation.  \n\n**Capital Structure:**  \n- **Total Debt Facilities Drawn**: $7.27M (includes $5.18M HOPE SPV convertible notes).  \n\n**Key Implications:**  \n1. Positive clinical data may enhance valuation but liquidity risk persists.  \n2. SPV funding model reduces parent-level dilution but hinges on trial milestones.  \n\n*Omitted: Director names, routine operational details, non-material financial line items.*",
