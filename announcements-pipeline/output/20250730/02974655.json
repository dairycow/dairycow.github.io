  "summary": "### **Quarterly Report (Appendix 4C) Summary**  \n\n#### **Financial & Operational Highlights:**  \n- **Cash receipts**: $2.2m (69% QoQ increase).  \n- **Operating cash outflow**: $0.7m (52% reduction QoQ).  \n- **Cash balance**: $0.64m (expected to grow materially by Dec-2025).  \n- **FY25 revenue**: ~$8.5m (slightly below expectations, impacted by datapowa closure).  \n- **Path to profitability**: Targets positive operating cash flow by Dec-2025 (Q4 CY25), driven by Ontario (iGO) contract milestones.  \n\n#### **Key Contracts & Pipeline:**  \n- **BetStop (Australia)**: Renewed for 2 years; 45k+ registrations, 30k active users; 28bn+ verifications.  \n- **Ontario (iGO)**: Milestones 3 & 4 completed; beta trials commenced; further cash inflows expected in CY2025.  \n- **Pipeline**: Advanced discussions in Alberta (Canada) and other jurisdictions; domestic land-based CSE proposal pending (decision expected Sept-2025).  \n\n#### **Strategic Updates:**  \n- **Divestment**: datapowa division wound down due to underperformance.  \n- **Focus**: Prioritizing RegTech (scalable SaaS model) over non-core segments.  \n\n#### **Risk Note**:  \n- Funding runway: 0.92 quarters based on current burn rate, but management expects improved liquidity from contract receipts. No immediate capital raising plans.  \n\n*Format: Strictly material trading/capital markets data, omitting fluff.*",
