  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary \u2013 Heavy Rare Earths Limited (ASX:HRE)**  \n**Announcement Type: Quarterly Report (Appendix 4C/5B)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n**1. Exploration Results (Radium Hill U-Sc-REE Project, SA):**  \n- High-grade assays from reconnaissance rock sampling:  \n  - **Uranium (U3O8):** Up to **9,068 ppm (20 lb/t)**.  \n  - **Scandium (Sc2O3):** Up to **936 ppm**.  \n  - **Rare Earth Oxides (TREO):** Up to **18,899 ppm (1.89%)**, including high-value heavy rare earths (HREEs) like Dy, Tb, and Y.  \n- Mineralisation extends **4.3 km northeast** of historic mine, suggesting potential for expanded resource.  \n- Airborne geophysical survey completed; 3D structural model underway to guide drilling (planned H2 2025).  \n\n**2. Perenjori U Project (WA):**  \n- Soil sampling identified **8 km-long uranium anomaly** (up to **138 ppm U**), comparable to known WA uranium deposits.  \n- No significant REE anomalies detected.  \n\n**3. Financial Position (Appendix 5B):**  \n- **Quarter-end cash balance: A$1.935 million** (down from A$2.406m last quarter).  \n- **Net cash used in operations: A$0.467m** (primary outflows: exploration and corporate costs).  \n- **Estimated funding runway:** ~4 quarters at current burn rate.  \n\n**4. Other Projects:**  \n- **Cowalinya (WA):** 159Mt @ 870 ppm TREO resource; metallurgical tests confirm potential for acid-leach processing.  \n- **Duke (NT):** 7 km\u00b2 REE soil anomaly adjacent to historic high-grade drill intercepts (e.g., 42m @ 770 ppm TREO).  \n\n---  \n**Omitted:** Routine operational details, director names, minor project updates, and non-material financial line items.  \n**Valuation Impact:** High-grade U-Sc-REE results and advancing exploration likely to attract investor interest in critical minerals sector. Tight cash position may necessitate future capital raising.",
