Drilling success at Bousquet (visible gold) and Dufay (copper mineralization) supports exploration upside.  \n2. Tight cash position pre-placement (0.97 quarters coverage) mitigated by capital raise.  \n\n**Omitted**: Routine tenement details, director names, non-material operational updates.  \n\nFormatting adheres strictly to brevity and materiality rules. Let me know if you'd like further refinement.",
