  "summary": "### **EROAD FY25 Group Climate Statement Summary**  \n\n#### **Key Material Information for Capital Markets:**  \n\n1. **Climate Reporting Compliance**  \n   - Second annual climate-related disclosure under Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards (aligned with FY25 Sustainability Report).  \n   - Excludes Scope 3 \"use of sold products\" emissions (immaterial to overall footprint).  \n\n2. **Emissions Data (FY25 vs. FY23 Baseline)**  \n   - **Scope 1 (Direct emissions):** 152.5 tCO\u2082e (-9% vs. FY23).  \n   - **Scope 2 (Indirect energy emissions):** 74.4 tCO\u2082e (-9% vs. FY23).  \n   - **Scope 3 (Indirect value chain emissions):** 11,189 tCO\u2082e (-53% vs. FY23).  \n   - **Total emissions:** 11,416 tCO\u2082e (-53% vs. FY23).  \n   - **Assurance:** Independent verification by Toit\u016b Envirocare (reasonable assurance for Scopes 1\u20132, limited for Scope 3).  \n\n3. **Targets**  \n   - **Short-term:** Achieved FY25 targets (4% reduction in Scope 1, 15% in Scope 2, intensity basis).  \n   - **Medium-term:** 28% reduction in Scope 1 and 29% in Scope 2 by FY28 (intensity basis).  \n   - **Long-term:**  \n     - 54.6% absolute reduction in Scopes 1\u20132 by 2033 (vs. FY23).  \n     - 61% reduction in emissions intensity per $1M revenue by 2033.  \n     - Net-zero commitment by 2050 (Scopes 1\u20133).  \n\n4. **Operational Highlights**  \n   - Reduced freight emissions via bulk shipping and rail use.  \n   - 100% global e-waste recycling for returned hardware (up from NZ-only in FY24).  \n   - Energy: Switched NZ electricity to 100% renewable provider (Ecotricity).  \n\n5. **Customer Impact**  \n   - Sustainability Module (launched FY24) used by 1,005 NZ customers for emissions tracking.  \n   - AI dashcam (\"Clarity Edge\") reduced high-risk driving events, improving safety and fuel efficiency.  \n   - Refrigerated fleet customers cut fuel use by 65% via temperature monitoring.  \n\n6. **Governance**  \n   - Board and Finance/Risk/Audit Committee oversee climate strategy.  \n   - No material climate risks identified in FY25; integrated into enterprise risk framework.  \n\n7. **Transition Plan**  \n   - Focus areas: Decarbonizing operations, supply chain resilience, enabling customer decarbonization.  \n   - FY26: Targets to be set for Scope 3 reductions and customer-focused metrics.  \n\n**Conclusion:** No immediate trading impact, but progress on emissions reductions and customer-facing sustainability tools may strengthen long-term value proposition. Disclosure aligns with NZ standards, though Scope 3 data gaps remain.  \n\n**Next Steps:** Monitor FY26 targets (Scope 3 expansion, customer emissions tracking).  \n\n*No material operational or financial disruptions noted.*",
