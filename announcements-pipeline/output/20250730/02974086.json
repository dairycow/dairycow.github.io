  "summary": "## **EROAD FY25 Climate Statement Summary**  \n\n### **Key Material Information:**  \n1. **Climate Disclosure**  \n   - EROAD published its second annual **Group Climate Statement**, complying with Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards.  \n   - Report focuses on **climate-related risks, opportunities, and emissions reduction strategies**.  \n\n2. **Emissions & Targets**  \n   - **FY25 Emissions**:  \n     - **Total GHG emissions**: **11,416 tCO\u2082e** (53% reduction from FY23 baseline).  \n     - **Scope 1 (Direct)**: 152.5 tCO\u2082e (-9% YoY).  \n     - **Scope 2 (Energy)**: 74.4 tCO\u2082e (-9% YoY).  \n     - **Scope 3 (Indirect)**: 11,189 tCO\u2082e (-53% YoY, driven by operational efficiencies).  \n   - **Science-aligned targets**:  \n     - **54.6% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 2033** (vs. FY23).  \n     - **61% reduction in emissions intensity (per $1M revenue)** by 2033.  \n     - **Net Zero by 2050** (Scopes 1, 2, and 3).  \n\n3. **Operational Highlights**  \n   - Reduced **freight emissions** via consolidated shipments and rail usage in NZ/AU.  \n   - **100% hardware waste diverted from landfill** (global e-waste recycling program).  \n   - Shift to **100% renewable electricity** in NZ (Ecotricity) and site consolidation.  \n\n4. **Customer Impact**  \n   - **Sustainability Module (NZ)**: 1,005 fleet customers tracking emissions (launched FY24).  \n   - **AI dashcams (Clarity Edge)**: Reduced high-risk driving, lowering fuel use and accidents.  \n   - **Cold-chain efficiency**: Customers cut pre-cooling time by **65%**, reducing fuel waste.  \n\n5. **Governance & Risks**  \n   - Board and **Sustainability Committee** oversee climate strategy.  \n   - Key risks: **Supply chain disruption, regulatory shifts, tech competition**.  \n   - Opportunities: **EV integration, emissions-data partnerships, fleet decarbonization tools**.  \n\n6. **Assurance & Compliance**  \n   - Emissions data assured by **Toit\u016b Envirocare** (Scope 1\u20132: reasonable assurance; Scope 3: limited).  \n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nEROAD\u2019s focus remains on **internal decarbonization** (e.g., fleet electrification, renewables) and **enabling customer emissions reduction** (via telematics/AI). No material financial impacts or capital raises announced.  \n\n---  \n**Note**: Excluded non-material details (e.g., governance names, operational HR metrics).
