  "summary": "**EROAD FY25 Group Climate Statement \u2013 Material Information Summary**  \n\n*Key Takeaways for Capital Markets Participants:*  \n\n### **Climate-Related Disclosures & Strategy**  \n- **Second annual climate statement** aligned with Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards.  \n- **Net Zero Commitment**: Target to achieve net zero Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by **2050**, with interim science-aligned targets:  \n  - **54.6% reduction in absolute Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 2033** (2023 baseline).  \n  - **61% reduction in emissions intensity (per $1M revenue) by 2033**.  \n- **Scope 3 Emissions**: 98% of FY25 total emissions (11,416 tCO2e, **down 53% YoY**), excluding \"use of sold products\" (immaterial per adoption provisions).  \n- **Transition Plan**: Focus on decarbonizing operations, customer enablement (e.g., fuel efficiency tools), and supply chain resilience.  \n\n### **Operational Highlights**  \n- **FY25 Achievements**:  \n  - **Freight/logistics**: Shifted to rail (NZ) and bulk shipments; reduced air freight reliance.  \n  - **Circular economy**: **100% hardware recycling** (global rollout vs. NZ-only in FY24).  \n  - **Fleet/energy**: Downsized fleet vehicles, migrated to EVs, and switched NZ electricity to **100% renewable** (Ecotricity).  \n- **Customer Impact**:  \n  - Refrigerated fleets using EROAD tools achieved **65% pre-cooling time reduction** and **50% fewer temperature faults**.  \n  - AI dashcams (\"Clarity Edge\") improved safety, reducing fuel waste from incidents.  \n\n### **Financial & Risk Management**  \n- **FY25 Spend**:  \n  - **$0.2M** on emissions tools (Watershed), advisory (PwC), and assurance (Toit\u016b).  \n  - **$1.6M** invested in FY24 for NZ Sustainability Module (1,005 active accounts by FY25).  \n- **Risks**:  \n  - **Transition**: Policy/tech shifts (e.g., EV adoption), competition in emissions tracking.  \n  - **Physical**: Supply chain disruptions from climate events (low material impact to date).  \n- **No material climate risks** identified in FY25; integrated into enterprise risk framework.  \n\n### **Governance & Metrics**  \n- Board/FRAC oversight; Sustainability Committee drives initiatives.  \n- **Assurance**: Toit\u016b provided **reasonable assurance** for Scope 1\u20132, **limited assurance** for Scope 3.  \n- **Key Metrics**:  \n  - **Emissions intensity**: **58.72 tCO2e per $1M revenue** (down 60% vs. FY23).  \n  - **Contracted units**: **255,845** (up 13% vs. FY23).  \n\n*Conclusion*: Progress on decarbonization and customer solutions, but Scope 3 remains a focus. No immediate trading impact; monitor execution against 2033 targets and EV/telematics competition.  \n\n---  \n**Note**: Excluded non-material operational updates, director details, and legal boilerplate. Focused on data impacting valuation, liquidity, or capital structure.",
