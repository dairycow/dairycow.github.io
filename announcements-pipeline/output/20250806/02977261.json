  "summary": "- **Key Development**: US NRC accepted Global Laser Enrichment\u2019s (GLE) licence application for the Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility (PLEF), advancing regulatory progress for SILEX uranium enrichment technology.  \n- **Potential Impact**: Successful licensing and commercialization could position SILEX as a major contributor to nuclear fuel production (natural uranium, LEU, HALEU) amid strong nuclear industry tailwinds.  \n- **Risks**: Project remains contingent on TRL-6 Pilot success, market conditions, feasibility outcomes, and regulatory approvals.  \n\n*Omitted: Forward-looking disclaimers, routine corporate details.*",
