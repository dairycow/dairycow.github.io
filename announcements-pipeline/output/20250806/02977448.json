  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Acquisition of Gold-Antimony Projects in New Zealand**  \n- **Transactions:**  \n  - **Cap Burn (EP60300):** 100% acquired in exchange for a **1.5% NSR royalty** (0.5% to each of three vendors).  \n  - **Koura Permits (Silver Peaks, Lammerlaw, Tokomairiro, Croesus):** 90% stake acquired for:  \n    - **Upfront payment:** $60,000 cash.  \n    - **Deferred payments:**  \n      - $150,000 cash or 37.5M CRR shares (seller\u2019s choice) on conversion to exploration permits.  \n      - $300,000 cash or 37.5M CRR shares (seller\u2019s choice) if a JORC resource >250koz Au-equivalent (\u22650.5 g/t) is announced.  \n  - **Exploration commitment:** Minimum $300,000 expenditure over two years across Koura Permits.  \n\n- **Strategic Rationale:**  \n  - **Cap Burn** is drill-ready, adjacent to OceanaGold\u2019s **10Moz Macraes mine** and Santana\u2019s **2.3Moz Bendigo-Ophir project**.  \n  - Historical drilling intersected **9m @ 0.24 g/t Au**, **1.8m @ 0.76 g/t Au**, and **6m @ 0.45 g/t Au**.  \n  - **Total land package:** **1,463 km\u00b2** across Otago and Reefton regions.  \n  - New Zealand\u2019s \"Fast-Track\" reforms expected to expedite permitting.  \n\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Transactions to close **September 2025**.  \n  - Immediate exploration planned for Cap Burn; prospecting permits pending approval.  \n\n#### **Key Risks & Considerations**  \n- Permits are applications (not yet granted).  \n- Koura Permits are early-stage; CRR carries 90% of costs until development decision (Koura can convert to 1.5% NSR or contribute).  \n\n**No capital raising, financials, or trading halt details identified.**  \n\n---  \n*Summary strictly focused on material capital markets impact. Omitted operational/geological details unless directly valuation-relevant.*",
