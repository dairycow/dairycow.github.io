  "summary": "- **Divestment of Brisbane Technology Park (BTP) assets**:  \n  - Total net sale price: **$155.5 million** (4.1% discount to 30 June 2025 independent valuation).  \n  - **Transaction 1**: $110.7M sale to Corval (settlement late August 2025).  \n  - **Transaction 2**: $44.8M sale to Exceed Capital (settlement by early November 2025, contingent on Transaction 1).  \n\n- **Strategic impact**:  \n  - Transforms DXI into a **focused industrial REIT**, improving portfolio metrics (higher occupancy, WALE).  \n  - **Gearing reduction**: ~7pp decrease from BTP sale; ~5pp net reduction including Glendenning acquisition.  \n  - Post-divestment gearing remains **below target range (30-40%)**, preserving reinvestment capacity.  \n\nThis summary excludes non-material details like management commentary and background boilerplate.",
