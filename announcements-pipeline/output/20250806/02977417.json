  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary: G11 Resources Wilandra Copper Project Exploration Target (ASX Announcement 6 August 2024)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **Maiden Exploration Target** estimated for **Peveril, Central Gossan, and Grasmere zones** at the Wilandra Copper Project.  \n- **Potential Mineralization Range:**  \n  - **15.6\u201321.2 Million Tonnes** at **0.8\u20131.6% Copper**, containing **170,000\u2013250,000 tonnes of copper**.  \n  - *(*Conceptual in nature; insufficient exploration to estimate a JORC-compliant Mineral Resource.)*  \n- **Exploration Scope:**  \n  - **4.0 km strike length** of outcropping mineralization, open at depth and along strike.  \n  - **Geophysical surveys and drilling planned** to test for VMS-style and structurally controlled copper-rich massive sulfides.  \n- **Historical Context:**  \n  - **Historic JORC (2004) resource** estimated ~9.2Mt, suggesting potential upside from current exploration.  \n\n#### **Next Steps:**  \n- Further **ground-based EM and IP surveys** to refine targets.  \n- **RC and diamond drilling** to extend mineralization along strike and at depth.  \n\n#### **Market Impact:**  \n- Material upside potential for G11 Resources if exploration confirms the scale of mineralization.  \n\n*No capital raising, financials, or timetable updates provided.*  \n\n**Note:** Exploration targets are speculative; no certainty exists that further work will define a Mineral Resource.",
