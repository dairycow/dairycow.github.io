  "summary": "### Material Information Summary (Drilling Results Announcement):\n\n- **Exploration Highlights**:\n  - **Danvers Copper Project**:\n    - Maiden drilling (May 2025) confirmed historic resource with intercepts including **175m @ 2.5% Cu**, **90m @ 4% Cu**, and **105m @ 2.25% Cu**.\n    - Summer campaign (August 2025) extended mineralization strike length to **>400m** (up from initial ~150m).\n    - **Visible sulphides** observed in all 4 completed holes (assays pending September 2025).\n    - Notable intercept: **DAN25012** (100m step-out) \u2013 **59m of visible sulphides** from 56m, including **>10m of ~5% bornite + 3% chalcocite**.\n    - Target for further drilling: Expand to **>800m strike** and test new outcrop zone **4.5km SW** of Danvers.\n\n- **Upcoming Catalysts**:\n  - **Assay results** (Danvers + Hulk Project) expected **September 2025**.\n  - **Drone MT survey results** (Danvers lease) due **late August 2025**.\n\n- **Operational Update**:\n  - Diamond drilling resumed at **Hulk Project** with new contractor; initial assays also expected September.\n\n- **Caution**: Visual estimates only; assays required to confirm grades.  \n\n**No capital markets activity (e.g., raising, trading halt) identified.**  \n*Focus: Extension of high-grade copper mineralization and pending assays.*",
