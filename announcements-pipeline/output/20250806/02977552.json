  "summary": "### Summary of Material Information:\n\n- **Government Policy Announcement Impact**: NZ government plans to transition all vehicles to electronic Road User Charging (eRUC), expanding the system from ~1M to ~4.5M vehicles by 2027.  \n- **EROAD's Position**: EROAD's existing GPS-based eRUC platform (used for commercial fleets) is well-positioned to support this expansion, having collected **$900M in eRUC for NZ heavy vehicles in the past year**.  \n- **Opportunity**: Private sector providers (like EROAD) will be permitted to offer integrated billing solutions (tolls, time-of-use pricing), creating potential revenue growth.  \n\n*No direct capital markets action (e.g., raising, halt) or financial data disclosed.*",
