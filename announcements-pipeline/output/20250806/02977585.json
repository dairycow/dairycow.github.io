  "summary": "Here\u2019s the concise summary of material information from the Orezone Gold Corporation Restricted Share Unit (RSU) Plan announcement:  \n\n### **Key Material Points**  \n- **Plan Purpose**: Align interests of eligible persons (employees, officers, consultants, directors) with shareholders and incentivize retention.  \n- **Maximum Shares Issuable**: 7.5 million Shares, subject to a **10% cap** of outstanding shares across all security-based compensation arrangements at any time.  \n- **Insider Limits**:  \n  - Maximum 10% of outstanding shares issuable to insiders annually or cumulatively.  \n  - Individual limit: 5% of outstanding shares annually.  \n  - Consultant limit: 2% of outstanding shares annually.  \n- **Vesting & Redemption**:  \n  - RSUs vest per Board-determined schedule; redemption occurs at end of Restricted Period (cash or shares at Fair Market Value).  \n  - **Change in Control**: Accelerated vesting/redemption if successor does not assume RSUs or if employment is terminated within 2 years post-event.  \n- **Tax Considerations**:  \n  - US/Canadian tax rules may delay redemption timing (e.g., Section 409A compliance for US taxpayers).  \n  - No dividend rights or interest accrual on RSUs.  \n- **Amendments**: Shareholder approval required for changes to share limits; other amendments may bypass approval if technical or non-material.  \n\n**Material Impact**: Potential dilution (up to 10% of shares outstanding) and alignment of management incentives with shareholder value.  \n\n*Omitted*: Definitions, boilerplate, and non-material administrative details.",
