  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (ASX:KAI \u2013 6 August 2025 Announcement)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **New gold discovery**: Drilling intercepted a significant new zone (\"Monster\") near Main Hill at Mt York, WA:  \n  - **Best intercept**: 53m @ **1.45 g/t Au** (incl. 10m @ **2.95 g/t Au**).  \n  - Mineralisation remains **open in all directions**, with potential to expand the **1.4Moz resource**.  \n- **Drilling progress**:  \n  - 52 holes completed (13,536m) in **Stage 1** (80-hole, 18,000m program).  \n  - Results from **19 holes** reported, including high-grade intercepts:  \n    - 3m @ **7.20 g/t Au** (Gossan Hill).  \n    - 62m @ **0.78 g/t Au** (Main Hill).  \n- **Resource impact**: Results expected to **boost resource size** ahead of an updated MRE in **2H 2025**.  \n- **Next steps**:  \n  - Additional drilling to test extensions of the \"Monster\" zone.  \n  - Finalise **mineral rights agreement** with PLS for further exploration.  \n  - Commence **Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS)** work, including metallurgical testing.  \n\n#### **Valuation Impact**:  \n- Potential **resource upgrade** from new high-grade intercepts and extensional drilling.  \n- Progress toward **development studies** (PFS, metallurgy) supports project de-risking.  \n\n**Omitted**: Routine operational details, director commentary, JORC technical appendices.",
