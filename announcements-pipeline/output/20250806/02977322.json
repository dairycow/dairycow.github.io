  "summary": "- **Feasibility Study Progress**: Advancing feasibility study for tailings reprocessing at Tick Hill, building on 2020 PFS findings.  \n- **Independent PEA Validation**: Confirmed technical/financial viability of tailings retreatment, recommending progression to feasibility.  \n- **Testwork Underway**: Current trial testwork on tailings to optimize grind size, energy use, throughput, and gold recovery metrics.  \n- **Historical Gold Grade**: Tick Hill produced 534,000oz at 25g/t Au historically; PFS used conservative gold price (A$2,300/oz vs. current spot).  \n- **Potential Upside**: PEA identified opportunities for additional tailings material and higher-grade open-pit mining (pending further study).  \n\n*No capital raising, trading halt, or financial figures disclosed.*",
