Below is the material information extracted in a concise format:\n\n### **Key Highlights**  \n1. **Exploration Target**  \n   - Potential high-grade **gold-antimony (Au-Sb) mineralization** at the Sunday Creek project (Victoria, Australia).  \n   - **Exploration upside**: Only 10% of the 10km trend tested; significant depth extensions likely.  \n\n2. **Operational & Financial Metrics**  \n   - **Cash Balance**: **A$165M** (as of August 2025).  \n   - **Market Cap**: **A$1.4B** (basic, 221.6M shares issued).  \n   - **Major Shareholders**: UHNW (31.2%), Institutions (23.7%).  \n\n3. **Grade & Scale Potential**  \n   - **High-grade intercepts**:  \n     - 0.2m @ **4,700 g/t Au + 0.26% Sb** (SDDSC161).  \n   - **Metallurgy**: Non-refractory, simple recovery (92.3\u201395.6% Au recovery).  \n\n4. **Pathway to Production**  \n   - **Fully funded** for exploration/development.  \n   - **Government support**: Victoria expediting permits (4 recent mine approvals since Dec 2024).  \n\n5. **Strategic Positioning**  \n   - **Rare asset**: High-grade, large-scale, critical antimony component (defense applications).  \n   - **Neighboring mines**: Proximity to Fosterville and Costerfield (high-margin operations).  \n\nNo capital raising, M&A, or material financial changes were announced. Focus remains on exploration progress and project scalability.  \n\n**Summary**: A high-grade, growth-stage gold-antimony project with strong funding and exploration momentum.
