  "summary": "This is a **Corporate Governance Statement**, which primarily details governance frameworks and compliance rather than material trading or capital markets information. Below is the concise extraction of any material points relevant to investors:  \n\n### **Material Takeaways for Capital Markets/Trading Decisions**  \n1. **Board Composition & Independence**  \n   - 7 non-executive directors (3 independent) + 1 executive director (CEO).  \n   - Majority shareholder News Corp nominates 4 directors (not independent).  \n\n2. **Key Focus Areas for FY25**  \n   - Strategic transactions (M&A) and capital management initiatives.  \n   - Search for a new CEO and Chief Strategy Officer underway.  \n\n3. **Gender Diversity Metrics (as of 30 June 2025)**  \n   - **Board**: 37.5% female (no 30% target set due to News Corp\u2019s nomination rights).  \n   - **Executive Leadership**: 50% female.  \n\n4. **Risk Management**  \n   - Updated Risk Management Policy aligned with ISO 31000:2018.  \n   - Focus on digital transformation, cyber security, and ESG risks.  \n\n5. **Related-Party Considerations**  \n   - 20% stake in Move, Inc. (operator of realtor.com\u00ae).  \n\n6. **Trading Policy**  \n   - Blackout periods enforced post-quarter-end until results release.  \n   - Directors/executives barred from hedging REA securities.  \n\n**No material capital markets or trading-specific updates (e.g., capital raisings, material operational/financial metrics) identified.**  \n\n*Note: Corporate governance disclosures are routine unless they directly impact capital structure, control, or material risks.*",
