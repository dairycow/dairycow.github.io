  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Upcoming Drilling Campaign**:  \n  - Phase 1 drilling (\u22651,000m) at Mt Turner Gold Project (Queensland) to commence within 8 weeks.  \n  - Targets: Extensions of gold mineralization beneath existing pits (Rocky Reward, Drummer Girl/Boy/East/West).  \n\n- **Soil Sampling Program**:  \n  - 9 km of soil sampling along Drummer Hill Fault System (starting next week) to identify gold anomalies.  \n\n- **Historic High-Grade Intercepts** (supporting exploration potential):  \n  - 16m @ 3.56 g/t Au, 16m @ 3.60 g/t Au, 12m @ 6.5 g/t Au.  \n\n- **Funding**:  \n  - Recent $2M placement secured for exploration. Lotus Minerals funded $100k for initial preparations.  \n\n- **Key Risk**:  \n  - Proposed acquisition of Lotus Minerals (including Mt Turner) remains conditional; no certainty of completion.  \n\n*Note: No capital raising, trading halt, or financials disclosed. Focus is exploration progress and resource potential.*",
