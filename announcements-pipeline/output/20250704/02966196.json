  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n- **Key Issue**: Renewal of Mineral Leases MLN542 and MLN543 at Rum Jungle Project quashed by Supreme Court due to \"reasonable apprehension of bias.\"  \n- **Implication**: Renewal applications will be reassessed by a new delegate (no prior involvement in related criminal proceedings).  \n- **Impact**: Uncertainty over lease renewals (critical for Sundance Gold Mine operations). No immediate operational disruption, but regulatory risk increased.  \n- **Next Update**: Company to advise once Department of Mines and Energy makes new determination.  \n\n*No other material information identified.*",
