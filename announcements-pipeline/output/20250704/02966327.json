  "summary": "- **Clarification on Metal Equivalent Calculations**: Copper Equivalent (CuEq) formula restated for Bronze Fox Project:  \n  - **CuEq % = Cu % + (0.95 \u00d7 Au g/t) + (0.00049 \u00d7 Mo ppm)**  \n  - Based on metal prices: **Cu $4.06/lb, Au $2,634.4/oz, Mo $20/lb**.  \n  - Metallurgical recoveries (prior studies): **90% Cu, 78% Au** (using conservative prices: Cu $3.40/lb, Au $1,400/oz).  \n\n- **Non-Material Disclosure**:  \n  - Slides in prior presentations (Jan/Apr 2025) included **formatting images (non-mineralisation estimates)** and omitted prior metal equivalent assumptions (now clarified).  \n  - Ground gravity survey mentioned in June 2025 announcements was **not JORC-compliant exploration results** (used only for drill targeting).  \n\n**No material trading or capital markets impact identified** (clarificatory in nature).",
