  "summary": "- **Updated FY25 uNPAT guidance**: Expected at lower end of analyst range ($27.0M\u2013$34.4M), reflecting pressure from global RV sales challenges and reduced manufacturing volumes.  \n- **FY26 outlook**:  \n  - Opening net debt ~$500M (excluding IFRS 16 leases).  \n  - Double-digit rental revenue growth in all markets except USA (single-digit decline).  \n  - NZ/AU forward rentals +25% YoY; USA bookings recovering post-Liberation Day dip.  \n- **Potential goodwill impairment**: NZ$36M (USA business) under review due to uncertain travel outlook. Other non-cash one-offs possible (statutory NPAT impact only).  \n- **Covenants unaffected** by potential impairments.  \n\n**Key risks**: Weak USA demand, manufacturing slowdown, pending impairment decision.  \n**Catalysts**: Future announcements on initiatives to address cyclical challenges.  \n\n*No material capital raising, trading halt, or liquidity events identified.*",
