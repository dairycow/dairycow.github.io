  "summary": "- **Updated FY25 uNPAT guidance**: Expects to be at lower end of analyst range ($27.0M\u2013$34.4M).  \n- **Key drivers**: Near-term pressure from global RV sales challenges and softer USA market; manufacturing earnings decline due to reduced volumes.  \n- **FY26 outlook**: Opening net debt ~$500M (ex-IFRS 16); forward rental revenue up double-digits in all markets except USA (single-digit decline there).  \n- **Impairment risk**: Preliminary assessment indicates potential goodwill impairment (NZ$36M for USA business); other non-cash one-offs may impact statutory NPAT (no covenant impact).  \n- **Forward bookings**: NZ/AU rentals +25% YoY; USA bookings initially dropped 40\u201350% post-Liberation Day but partially recovered.  \n\n(Excludes operational initiatives deemed non-material pending further details.)",
