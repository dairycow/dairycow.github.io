  "summary": "- **Updated FY25 Guidance**: FY25 underlying NPAT expected at lower end of analyst range ($27.0M\u2013$34.4M), citing weak global RV sales and reduced manufacturing volumes.  \n- **FY26 Outlook**: Opening net debt ~$500M; double-digit rental revenue growth in NZ/AU (25% higher forward bookings), but USA bookings down single-digit YoY post-seasonal recovery.  \n- **Potential Impairment**: Preliminary NZ$36M goodwill impairment likely for USA business due to uncertain travel demand; other non-cash one-offs possible (no covenant impact).  \n\n*No material capital markets actions (e.g., raising, trading halt) identified.*",
