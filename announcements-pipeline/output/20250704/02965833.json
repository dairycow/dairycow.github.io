  "summary": "- **FY25 uNPAT guidance**: Expected at lower end of analyst range ($27.0M\u2013$34.4M), citing weak global RV sales and USA market challenges.  \n- **Manufacturing decline**: Australia/NZ divisions face lower earnings due to reduced production volumes.  \n- **FY26 outlook**: Opening net debt ~$500M; strong rental revenue growth in NZ/AU (+25% YoY forward bookings).  \n- **USA market**: Forward bookings initially dropped 40\u201350% post-Liberation Day but now near typical levels; single-digit YoY revenue decline expected.  \n- **Potential impairments**: Preliminary assessment suggests possible NZ$36M goodwill impairment (USA business); other non-cash one-offs may impact statutory NPAT (no covenant effect).  \n\n*Omitted: Operational initiatives (non-specific), historical context, director details.*",
