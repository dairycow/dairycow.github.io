  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (Form 605)  \n\n- **Substantial Holder Ceases:** Peter Rohner (and associated entities) ceased to be a substantial holder in **GBM Resources Limited** (ASX: **GBZ**) on **27 June 2025**.  \n- **Reason for Cessation:** Dilution due to a share issue by the company (no further details provided on transaction terms or size).  \n- **Prior Holding:** Last disclosure filed on **15 March 2024**; no specific ownership percentage or stake disclosed in this notice.  \n\n**No other material trading or capital markets information identified.**  \n\n(Note: Form 605 is a standard disclosure of shareholding changes; the key takeaway is the exit of a previously reported substantial holder, likely reducing concentrated ownership.)",
