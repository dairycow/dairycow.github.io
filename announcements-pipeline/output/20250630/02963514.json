  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (Appendix 3Y - Change of Director\u2019s Interest Notice):  \n\n- **Director**: Vladimir Nikolaenko (Executive Chairman)  \n- **Key Issue**: Late lodgement due to unreported indirect interests in two related companies.  \n- **Holdings Update**: Net increase of **39.8M SRN shares** (52.9M bought, 13.1M sold) between 28/09/2018 and 24/04/2025.  \n- **Closed Period Breach**: Some trades occurred during closed periods without prior clearance (now addressed).  \n- **Post-Update Holdings**:  \n  - **639.9M fully paid ordinary shares** (ASX:SRN)  \n  - **28.4M options** (ASX:SRNOD)  \n  - **397.2M partly paid shares** (unquoted).  \n\n#### Material Implications:  \n1. **Governance Risk**: Prior non-compliance with ASX Listing Rules (3.19A/3.19B), though remediation claimed.  \n2. **Alignment Signal**: Director\u2019s continued accumulation of shares (~$522,831 spent) suggests confidence in SRN.  \n\n**No capital/financial data impacting valuation**. Focus on governance and director trading activity.  \n\n---  \n*Formatted for brevity; excluded historical trade details (attached schedule).*",
