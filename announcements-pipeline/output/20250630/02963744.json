Presidential approval for Amaam Entity acquisition still pending.  \n- **ASX Suspension**: Trading suspension since 3 March 2025 due to delayed financial reporting (Appendix 4E/accounts), caused by sanctions and restricted communication with Russian management.  \n- **Future Plans**: Potential delisting and wind-up post-transaction completion, but minimal surplus funds expected for shareholders due to reduced sale price (~A$46M) and buyer disputes.  \n\n*No other material information identified.*",
