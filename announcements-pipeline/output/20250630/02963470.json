  "summary": "Here is a concise summary of the key material information from the Dexus Climate Transition Action Plan announcement:\n\n- **Document Type**: Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) update  \n- **Material Points**:\n  - **Climate Aspirations**:  \n    - Maintain net zero Scope 1 & 2 emissions for Dexus-controlled portfolio ($53.4B real asset platform).  \n    - Target $2B in climate transition investments by 2035 (up from $1.2B as of Dec 2024).  \n    - Absolute zero Scope 1 & 2 emissions with minimal offsets (<3%) by 2040.  \n    - Support net zero value chain by 2050.  \n\n  - **Key Actions**:  \n    - Decarbonization: Electrify assets, expand rooftop solar/battery storage, and partner with tenants on emissions reduction.  \n    - Resilience: Enhance climate risk assessments (flood/heat focus) and adaptation for 7% high-risk assets.  \n    - Transition Investments: Scale renewable energy infrastructure (e.g., solar, EV charging) and sustainable forestry.  \n\n  - **Risks Highlighted**:  \n    - Transition: Carbon cost exposure (~$1-4M cooling cost increase by 2050 under 3\u00b0C scenario).  \n    - Physical: 69% of portfolio risk from flooding (50% impact in Queensland).  \n\n- **Governance**:  \n  - Climate targets tied to executive remuneration via Group Scorecard.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Disclose quantitative financial impacts of climate risks in FY26 per Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS).  \n\n**Omitted**: Background details, stakeholder quotes, non-material operational updates.  \n\n**Format**: Tailored to capital markets focus, emphasizing financial/material impacts.",
