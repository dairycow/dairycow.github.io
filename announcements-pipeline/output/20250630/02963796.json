  "summary": "- **Material Information Identified**:  \n  - **Unacceptable Circumstances Declaration**: Takeovers Panel declared actions by Emu NL's directors regarding a share placement and EGM conduct as unacceptable, affecting control and voting integrity.  \n  - **Capital Raising**: On 14 May 2025, Emu issued 17,647,057 shares (~8.35% dilution) at $0.017/share ($300k total), timed with an EGM.  \n  - **Governance Issues**:  \n    - Placement shares issued to four investors on EGM day, potentially influencing vote outcomes.  \n    - Proxy forms were biased (pre-populated \"AGAINST\" resolutions), disadvantaging shareholders.  \n    - Record date confusion and delayed disclosures undermined market confidence.  \n  - **Regulatory Breaches**:  \n    - Northmead Holdings failed to lodge a substantial holder notice on time.  \n    - Emu contravened interim orders by delaying proxy disclosures.  \n\n*Omitted: Procedural details, director names, legal references.*",
