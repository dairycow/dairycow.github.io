  "summary": "Here's the extracted material information tailored for capital markets decision-making:  \n\n### **Material Information Summary**  \n- **Drilling Results**:  \n  - **BD Target 1 (BDT1)**:  \n    - 66m @ **1.07 g/t Au** from 33m (including 29m @ **1.46 g/t Au**).  \n    - 71.72m @ **0.72 g/t Au** from 187m (including 6.50m @ **1.72 g/t Au**).  \n  - **BD Target 3 (BDT3)**:  \n    - 8.34m @ **1.95 g/t Au** from 132.66m (including 5.54m @ **2.88 g/t Au**).  \n- **Resource Growth Plans**:  \n  - **Boundiali Project**:  \n    - Ongoing **100,000m drilling program** in 2025.  \n    - **Two MRE updates planned**: First in July 2025 (incorporating these results), second by late 2025.  \n    - Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) targeted for completion by **end of CY2025**.  \n  - **Napi\u00e9 Project**:  \n    - **30,000m drilling program** commencing June 2025 to expand current **0.87Moz MRE**.  \n- **Funding & Capital**:  \n  - **$35.6M private placement completed in May 2025** ensures fully funded exploration.  \n- **Project Scale**:  \n  - Combined **2.47Moz gold resources** (1.59Moz at Boundiali, 0.87Moz at Napi\u00e9).  \n  - Mineralization remains **open along strike and at depth**.  \n\n### **Key Takeaways for Traders/Investors**  \n1. **High-impact drilling results** support resource expansion potential.  \n2. **Aggressive 2025 drill programs** (130,000m total across both projects) with near-term catalysts (MRE updates, PFS).  \n3. **Strong liquidity position** post-$35.6M raise reduces financing risk.  \n\n*No material operational or financial red flags identified.*  \n\n**Note**: Omitted routine technical/assay details, non-material JORC data, and repetitive drilling tables.
