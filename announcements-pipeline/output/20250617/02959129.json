  "summary": "**Material Information Extracted:**  \n\n- **Exploration Target Identification**:  \n  - New gold-copper drilling targets identified at Coogee West Project (WA) through reprocessed geophysical data.  \n  - Targets include a 1.8km and 3km strike gold trend, untested or only shallowly drilled (\u226430m depth).  \n  - High-priority targets (CG-04 to CG-07) show strong magnetic anomalies akin to known mineralisation at Coogee North.  \n\n- **Upcoming Drilling Program**:  \n  - Exploration drilling planned for Q3 2025, focusing on highest-priority targets (CG-04 to CG-07).  \n\n- **Resource Context**:  \n  - Coogee Gold Project\u2019s existing MRE: **3.65Mt @ 1.08g/t Au (126,685 oz Au) and 1.01Mt @ 0.41% Cu (4,133t Cu)** (as of Aug 2024).  \n  - Eureka Gold Project MRE: **2.45Mt @ 1.42g/t Au (112,000 oz Au)** (as of June 2021).  \n\n**Key Takeaways for Traders**:  \n- Near-term catalyst: Drill program in Q3 2025 could re-rate stock if results confirm mineralisation.  \n- High-risk/high-reward exploration upside with undrilled targets in a proven gold-copper belt (near St Ives Goldfield).  \n- No material changes to existing resources; focus remains on exploration.  \n\n**Omitted**: Non-material geological details, historical context, JORC tables, and forward-looking disclaimers.",
