  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Strategic Partnership & Technology Breakthrough**  \n- **MOU signed with MTM Critical Metals (ASX: MTM)** for exclusive collaboration on refining **Meteoric\u2019s Mixed Rare Earth Carbonate (MREC)** using Flash Joule Heating (FJH) technology.  \n- **FJH test results show significant MREC upgrade**:  \n  - Magnetic rare earth oxide (MREO) content increased from **~30% to 72% of TREO**.  \n  - **High recovery rates** for key magnetic elements:  \n    - **Pr (76%)**, **Nd (65%)**, **Dy (75%)**, **Tb (81%)**, **Gd (89%)**.  \n  - **Removal of low-value elements**: **83% La**, **88% Ce** eliminated.  \n- **Exclusivity clause**: MTM barred from similar Brazil-based ionic clay REE deals with third parties during the 12-month MOU term.  \n\n#### **Next Steps**  \n- **Pilot plant development** (Po\u00e7os de Caldas, Brazil) targeted for **September 2025**, potentially hosting FJH demo facility.  \n- Further FJH optimization to improve recoveries and La/Ce rejection.  \n\n#### **Commercial Implications**  \n- Potential to establish **alternative Western supply chain** for critical magnetic REEs (Pr, Nd, Dy, Tb).  \n- Downstream integration could enhance **product value and market flexibility**.  \n\n**No capital raising, financials, or trading halt information identified.**",
