  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Key Partnership & Technology Breakthrough**:  \n  - Signed MoU with **MTM Critical Metals (ASX: MTM)** to apply **Flash Joule Heating (FJH)** technology for rare earth element (REE) separation.  \n  - **FJH Success**:  \n    - Recovered **76% Pr**, **65% Nd**, **75% Dy**, and **81% Tb** from Meteoric\u2019s MREC feedstock.  \n    - Removed **83% of low-value Lanthanum (La)**, increasing **magnetic REO content from ~30% to 72% of TREO**.  \n\n- **Strategic Impact**:  \n  - Potential scalable, modular REE refining alternative, reducing reliance on China-dominated supply chains.  \n  - Pilot plant development planned (**Po\u00e7os de Caldas, Brazil**) by **September 2025**, potentially hosting FJH demo facility.  \n\n- **Exclusivity**:  \n  - MTM barred from similar Brazil-based ionic clay projects with third parties during the **12-month MoU term**.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Further FJH optimization to improve recovery rates and reject low-value elements (e.g., Cerium).  \n\n*No capital raising, financials, or dated material events identified.*",
