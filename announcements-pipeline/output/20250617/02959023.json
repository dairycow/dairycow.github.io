  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n#### **Key Highlights from Phase 2 PROTECT Trial Results**  \n- **ISLA-101 demonstrated anti-dengue activity** in humans, supporting further clinical development.  \n- **Preventative cohort**:  \n  - Meaningful reduction in **viremia (viral load)** and symptoms.  \n  - Mean peak viral RNA reduced **~15x** vs. control (73k vs. 13M units).  \n- **Treatment cohort**:  \n  - Signals of drug effect observed (reduced viremia duration, symptom improvement).  \n  - One outlier with lower drug concentration noted; otherwise, trend toward efficacy.  \n- **Safety**: Well-tolerated with no major adverse events.  \n\n#### **Regulatory and Next Steps**  \n- **Pathways**: Advancing discussions with FDA for Phase 2b/3 trials (preventative and/or treatment arms).  \n- **Priority Review Voucher (PRV)**: Potential eligibility if FDA approved (~A$225M valuation cited).  \n- **Partnerships**: Engaging strategic partners for accelerated trials.  \n\n#### **Financial/Capital Data** (as of latest disclosures):  \n- **Cash balance (31 Mar 2024)**: A$4.82M (+A$3.6M May 2025 placement).  \n- **Market cap (16 Jun 2025)**: A$38.96M (@ A$0.165/share).  \n\n#### **Webinar**  \n- Date: 17 June 2025 (11:00 AM AEST).  \n\n*Omitted: Background stats, historical data, non-material operational details.*",
