  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary \u2013 SKY METALS LIMITED (ASX: SKY)**  \n\n#### **Exploration Results (Tallebung Tin Project)**  \n- **Significant drill intercepts** (expanding deposit footprint and confirming high-grade zones):  \n  - **TBRC137**: 33m @ 0.22% Sn (incl. 5m @ 0.65% Sn).  \n  - **TBRC134**: 47m @ 0.16% Sn (incl. 5m @ 0.61% Sn).  \n  - **TBRC138**: 12m @ 0.39% Sn (incl. 4m @ 0.80% Sn).  \n  - **TBRC127**: 32m @ 0.23% Sn (incl. 1m @ 2.23% Sn).  \n- **Deposit expansion**: Results confirm extensions to east/west, demonstrating Tallebung remains **open in all directions**, with higher grades discovered beyond existing Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) margins.  \n- **Progress**:  \n  - Assays received for **25 of 75 completed holes**; **85 additional holes approved** for drilling.  \n  - Program expanded from 70 to **150 holes total** to target further extensions.  \n- **Tin price context**: Management notes tin trades at **3x copper price**, underscoring high-value nature of near-surface mineralisation.  \n\n#### **Next Steps**  \n- Steady stream of assay results expected over coming months.  \n- Focus on **shallow, high-grade zones** to support early-stage mining viability and rapid CAPEX payback.  \n\n**No capital raising, financials, or material corporate updates identified.**  \n\n**Note**: Operational focus confirms resource growth potential but no immediate capital markets impact.",
