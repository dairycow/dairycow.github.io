  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n**Strategic Alliance & Earn-In Agreement Update**  \n- **South32 expands Strategic Alliance** to include two Botswana tenements (PL0074/2025 and PL0075/2025).  \n- **Earn-in terms**: South32 can acquire **60% interest** in Botswana tenements by funding **A$5M over 5 years** (minimum A$1M/quarter starting Q1 FY26).  \n- **Existing Humpback-Damara Project**: South32 committed to **A$15M over 5 years** (A$3M/year). Combined FY26 exploration budget: **A$4M/year**.  \n\n**Exploration Highlights**  \n- **Damara Project (Namibia)**:  \n  - **Anomalous copper** (up to 800ppm) in initial RC drilling.  \n  - New geological model suggests potential for basement-hosted copper deposits.  \n- **Fiesta Project**:  \n  - Two diamond holes completed; two more planned. Delays due to weather/rig issues.  \n  - Targets analogous to **Khoemacau Copper Project** (370Mt @ 1.7% CuEq).  \n\n**Financial/Liquidity Impact**  \n- South32 funding eliminates near-term exploration capex burden for Noronex.  \n- No dilution from equity raising; terms maintain Noronex as project operator.  \n\n**Additional Material Data** (Appendix 4C equivalent):  \n- Closing cash balance not disclosed, but FY26 exploration fully funded by South32.  \n\n*Omitted: JORC details, operational logistics, non-material drilling results.*",
