  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (Anson Resources Ltd - ASX:ASN)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **Higher Lithium Grades:** Recent assays show **average lithium concentration of 135 mg/l (44% higher** than the initial JORC resource estimate of 93.5 mg/l).  \n- **Clean Brine Advantage:** Low contaminants (e.g., Mg, Fe, B) vs. peers (e.g., Standard Lithium, Salton Sea), potentially reducing processing costs.  \n- **Resource Upgrade Planned:** Higher grades to be included in future JORC Mineral Resource updates.  \n- **Operational Insight:** Brine extraction (\"swabbing\") improved aquifer access, stabilizing lithium grades at ~135 mg/l after initial cleanup.  \n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Re-entry drilling at Mt Fuel-Skyline Geyser well to expand resource.  \n  - Hydrological tests to assess aquifer properties.  \n\n**No capital raising, trading halt, or financial data disclosed.**  \n\n*(Tailored for traders/investors: Focuses on material valuation-impacting technical results and project upside.)*",
