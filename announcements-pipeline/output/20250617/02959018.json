  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary - Anson Resources (ASX: ASN)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **Higher Lithium Grades:** Recent swabbing assays average **135 mg/l Li**, **44% higher** than the initial JORC resource estimate (93.5 mg/l).  \n- **Resource Upgrade Confirmed:** Higher grades will be incorporated into a **future JORC Mineral Resource upgrade**.  \n- **Clean Brine Advantage:** Low contaminants (e.g., Mg, Ca, B) compared to peers (Standard Lithium, Salton Sea), reducing processing costs.  \n- **Operational Efficiency:** Higher lithium concentration may lower OPEX by reducing brine throughput and disposal requirements.  \n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Re-entry of **Mt Fuel-Skyline Geyser well** (approved by regulators) to expand resource.  \n  - Flow/pump tests to assess aquifer properties.  \n  - Targeting porous zones near the **Ten Mile Graben**, a potential lithium brine pathway.  \n\n#### **Market Implications:**  \n- Positive for **resource scalability** and project economics.  \n- Confirms **technical viability** of the DLE process (98% Li recovery, 99% impurity rejection).  \n\nNo capital raising, trading halt, or financial figures disclosed.  \n\n*Summary tailored for trading/capital markets focus\u2014operational metrics omitted unless material.*",
