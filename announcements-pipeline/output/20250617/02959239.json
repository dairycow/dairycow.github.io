  "summary": "- **Creditors approved PRG's DOCA proposal for Centrex Ltd (CXM) and Agriflex**, including the Ardmore phosphate mine assets.  \n- **Key condition precedent**: PRG must finalize a binding rail haulage agreement with Aurizon by **27 June 2025** for mine viability.  \n- **Other DOCA conditions** must be met or waived by **31 August 2025** (or earlier court date).  \n- **Non-market-sensitive announcement**; no immediate trading impact.  \n\n*Note: Aurizon agreement is critical to mine economics; failure to secure it jeopardizes the deal.*",
