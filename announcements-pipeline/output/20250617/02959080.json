  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n**Announcement Type: Distribution Agreement**  \n\n- **Exclusive Distribution Rights**: RLF AgTech secures exclusive rights to market and distribute AXIOMA\u2019s biostimulant products in **Australia, China, and Asia**.  \n- **Product Focus**: Biostimulants target **cereals, canola, soybeans**, enhancing resilience against abiotic stress and nutrient efficiency.  \n- **Strategic Expansion**: Entry into biologicals segment complements RLF\u2019s existing fertiliser/nutrition portfolio, potentially unlocking **new margin opportunities**.  \n- **Term**: Initial agreement until **30 September 2026**, with automatic 2-year renewals unless terminated.  \n\n**Non-material**: Operational details, executive quotes, AXIOMA background.  \n\n**Impact**: Positive for RLF\u2019s revenue diversification and market positioning in sustainable agriculture.  \n\n*No capital markets actions (e.g., raising, halt) or financial metrics disclosed.*  \n\nFormat: Concise bullet points, stripped of non-material fluff. Focus on exclusivity, scale, and strategic implications.  \n\nLet me know if you'd adjust emphasis on any point.  \n\n*Notes:*  \n- If trading halt was requested, I'd state the reason in **one line**, e.g., *\"Pending release of material distribution agreement.\"*  \n- For capital raising, I'd list **$XXm, structure, key dates**.  \n- For 4C, I'd extract **cash balance + key metrics**.  \n\nThis approach ensures **only decision-useful data** is highlighted.",
