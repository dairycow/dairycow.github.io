  "summary": "### Summary of Material Information:  \n\n**Farm-In & Joint Venture Agreement Highlights:**  \n- **Parties:** Dart Mining NL (DTM) enters agreement with Great Divide Mining (GDM) for the **Coonambula Antimony-Gold Project** (Central Queensland).  \n- **Earn-In Structure:**  \n  - **Stage 1:** Dart earns **15% interest** via immediate payment of **AUD 250,000**.  \n  - **Stage 2:** Dart can earn additional **36% (total 51%)** by completing **4,000m drilling** and delivering **JORC resource estimates** within **26 months**.  \n    - **Drilling incentive:** 1% interest per 133.3m drilled.  \n    - **Resource incentive:** 3% per annual JORC-compliant resource/exploration target.  \n- **Key Project Data:**  \n  - High-grade intersections from historic drilling:  \n    - **3m @ 9.18% Sb**, **6m @ 5.12% Sb & 1.55g/t Au**, **3m @ 8.53g/t Au**.  \n  - Surface samples: Rock chips up to **44.9% Sb**, trenching up to **6.15g/t Au + 3.1% Sb**.  \n  - **IP Survey:** Govt-funded (CEI grant) to commence within 3 months; targets high-grade Sb-Au zones.  \n- **Exploration Plan:**  \n  - **Year 1:** 2,000m infill drilling at Banshee Mine for JORC resource.  \n  - **Year 2:** 2,000m drilling to expand targets (Perseverance gold mine, strike extensions).  \n\n**Capital Impact:**  \n- No immediate capital raising; Dart funds exploration via AUD 250k payment and operational commitments.  \n- Potential future dilutionary risk if Dart fails to meet earn-in milestones (GDM buy-out option at fair market value).  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- IP survey (Q3 2025), heritage assessments, and infill drilling at Banshee.  \n\n**Valuation Relevance:**  \n- Exposure to high-grade Sb-Au project in proximity to major deposits (e.g., Cracow gold mine).  \n- Potential resource definition catalyst within 12\u201324 months.  \n\n*Omitted:* Operational details, historical commentary, non-material geology.",
