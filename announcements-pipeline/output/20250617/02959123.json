  "summary": "**Production & Cost Guidance Update (St Barbara Limited - ASX:SBM)**  \n\n- **Revised FY25 Guidance**:  \n  - Gold production: 50,000\u201352,000 oz (previously undisclosed original target).  \n  - All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC): A$4,400\u20134,700/oz.  \n- **Q4 Jun FY25 Update**:  \n  - Production impacted by heavy rainfall at Simberi (100mm+ in June), delaying access to high-grade ore from Pigibo Central pit.  \n  - June output expected to be ~9,000 oz (lower recoveries due to alternative stockpile use).  \n  - Shortfall to be partly offset by gold-in-circuit drawdown; **no material cash/bullion impact** anticipated.  \n- **Key Financial Position**: No bank debt, no hedging.  \n\n*No material changes to capital structure or liquidity noted.*",
