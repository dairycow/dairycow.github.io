  "summary": "No material information identified.  \n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The document is a corporate presentation, not a trading or capital markets announcement.  \n- No new financial, operational, or strategic disclosures materially impacting valuation, liquidity, or capital structure were found.  \n- General project updates, historic resource estimates, and funding summaries (e.g., $3.6M Rights Issue, $5M grant) were already disclosed in prior ASX announcements (referenced in slides).  \n\n*Note:* Presentations typically recap known information; material updates are usually released via standalone ASX announcements.",
