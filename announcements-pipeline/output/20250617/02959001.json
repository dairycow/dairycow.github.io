  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement:  \n**Type:** Metallurgical Testwork Results (Heap Leach)  \n\n#### **Material Information:**  \n- **Key Results:**  \n  - **Recoveries from heap leach tests** (HLC-West composite, first 8\u201310 years of ore):  \n    - **Nd:** Up to **80%**  \n    - **Pr:** Up to **85%**  \n    - **Tb:** Up to **44%**  \n    - **Dy:** Up to **38%**  \n  - Optimal crush size: **12.5\u201325 mm** (reduces costs and improves heap leach performance).  \n- **Economic Implications:**  \n  - Heap leaching could **simplify processing**, eliminate capital-intensive roasting, and significantly **reduce capex/opex**.  \n  - Potential **phased development** (first phase: rare earth oxides; second phase: zirconium/niobium/hafnium).  \n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - **Heap Leach Scoping Study** (due early Q3 CY2025).  \n  - **Column leach testwork** (commencing June 2025).  \n- **Funding:** Supported by **A$5M Australian Federal Government grant**.  \n\n**Valuation Impact:** Positive for project economics due to lower-cost pathway and accelerated rare earth production.  \n\n---  \n**Note:** Omitted technical details (e.g., drill hole tables, JORC compliance) as non-material to trading decisions. Focused on recoveries, cost savings, and milestones.",
