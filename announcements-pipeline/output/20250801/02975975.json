  "summary": "- **Funds Removal from ASX mFund**: Franklin Templeton will remove 11 listed funds from ASX mFund effective **19 September 2025**, due to ASX's planned mFund service wind-down by 31 May 2026.  \n- **Key Deadline**: Last trading via mFund cutoff at **12 noon on 19 September 2025**. No buys/sells during blackout period (**20\u201326 September 2025**) as holdings transition to issuer-sponsored register.  \n- **Investor Actions Required**:  \n  - Complete **Client Identification Form** to avoid account restrictions (e.g., blocked distributions/redemptions).  \n  - Options: Sell via broker by deadline, convert to issuer-sponsored, or allow automatic transfer (with form submission still required).  \n- **Impact**: Reduced liquidity for these funds post-removal; transactions must occur directly through Franklin Templeton post-transition.  \n\n*Omitted: Fund-specific codes, legal disclaimers, general procedural details.*",
