  "summary": "Here\u2019s the material information extracted from the ASX announcement, formatted concisely for trading/capital markets purposes:\n\n### **Exploration Results Announcement**  \n- **Key drill intercepts**:  \n  - **LVRC02**: 18m @ 1.16 g/t Au from 127m (includes 5m @ 2.3 g/t Au).  \n  - Confirms extension of gold mineralization below prior shallow intercept (28m @ 1.09 g/t Au).  \n- **Geology**:  \n  - Mineralization hosted in altered quartz-feldspar volcanic rocks, open in all directions.  \n  - Indicators suggest a large-scale intrusion-hosted gold system.  \n- **Next steps**:  \n  - Immediate follow-up RC and diamond drilling planned to test strike/depth extensions.  \n  - Assays pending for REE targets (e.g., LVRC04/LVRC05; prior intercept: 4m @ 13,406ppm TREO).  \n- **Project context**: Located in Laverton Tectonic Zone (historic 25Moz gold province), near major operations (e.g., Gold Fields' Granny Smith, AngloGold\u2019s Sunrise Dam).  \n\n**No capital raising, financial data, or material changes to corporate structure identified.**  \n\n*Note: Updated version (1 Aug 2025) only adds drill collar dip/azimuth data; no material content changes.*",
