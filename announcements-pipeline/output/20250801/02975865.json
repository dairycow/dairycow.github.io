  "summary": "- **Substantial Holder Change**: Ian Jeffrey Gandel's voting power in **Australian Strategic Materials Limited (ASM)** decreased from **17.20% to 15.57%** due to dilution from a **share placement** by ASM.  \n- **Holdings Unchanged**: Total shares held remain **34,796,783 ORD**, but voting power diluted post-placement.  \n- **No Change in Associations**: No new associates or changes in associations reported.  \n\n**Material Implication**: Reduction in Gandel's voting power suggests increased share issuance by ASM, potentially impacting control dynamics. No further capital-raising details provided.",
