  "summary": "- **Clarification on CuEq Reporting**: Copper equivalent (CuEq) values in the MRE are based solely on in-situ metal grades and relative prices, with **100% recovery assumed for all metals** (Cu, Au, Mo) for comparison purposes.  \n- **Recoveries Preliminary**: Metallurgical test work to date is not optimised; recoveries mentioned should be viewed as **conservative lower-bound estimates**.  \n- **No Deleterious Elements**: Assaying indicates no material mineralogical elements impacting recoverability; metallurgy aligns with typical porphyry copper systems.  \n- **Future Updates**: Revised CuEq inputs (including recoveries) will be provided during **Scoping Study and PFS stages**.  \n\n*No material trading or capital markets impact identified (disclosure clarification only).*",
