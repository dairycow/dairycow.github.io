  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Resource Update Highlights**  \n- **Total MRE (Mineral Resource Estimate):**  \n  - **2.04Mt @ 1.69 g/t Au** (110,687 oz gold) \u2013 **16% increase in grade** vs. prior estimate.  \n  - **Indicated Resource:** 1.36Mt @ 1.8 g/t Au (78,678 oz) \u2013 **27% increase** in ounces.  \n  - **Inferred Resource:** 682kt @ 1.46 g/t Au (32,010 oz).  \n\n#### **Key Exploration/Production Upside**  \n- Mineralization extends **1.1km along strike** and **130m below current pit floor**, remaining **open** down-dip and along strike.  \n- New drilling confirms **potential for expanded production profile**; current studies focus on 34k oz recoverable, but updated MRE supports larger scope.  \n- **Near-term mining plan**: Targeting ~34k oz from southern Eureka Pit; discussions with contractors for 2026 start.  \n\n#### **Location & Infrastructure**  \n- Located on **granted Mining Lease** (50km N of Kalgoorlie, WA).  \n- Proximity to **Paddington Mill** (~20km S) enhances processing options.  \n\n#### **Next Steps**  \n- **Drilling program planned** to test down-dip extensions and further upgrade resources.  \n- Updated MRE to be integrated into mine planning studies.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nMaterial upgrade in **Indicated Resources (+27%) and grade (+16%)** with clear exploration upside. Near-term mining feasibility advancing, with potential to expand production scope.  \n\n**No capital raising, trading halt, or financial data disclosed.**  \n\nFormat: Concise, tailored for trading/capital markets focus. Excluded operational minutiae and non-material details.",
