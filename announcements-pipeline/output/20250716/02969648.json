  "summary": "### Material Information Summary (Exploration Update):\n\n- **Project Acquisition**:  \n  - Granite Castle Project acquired as part of a 2024 asset deal with Collins St Convertible Notes Pty Ltd.  \n  - Includes 2 exploration permits and 1 Mining Development Licence (MDL 2005).  \n\n- **Historic Drilling**:  \n  - Over **22,000m drilled** across MDL 2005:  \n    - Granite Castle shear: 255 holes (15,493m).  \n    - Coronation shear: 54 holes (3,540m).  \n  - **Notable intercepts**:  \n    - Coronation shear (GCRC 596): **3m @ 10 g/t Au, 153ppm Ag** (incl. 1m @ 24.9 g/t Au).  \n    - Granite Castle shear: **2004 JORC resource** (details referenced from prior announcements).  \n\n- **Exploration Upside**:  \n  - Shear zones extend **1km west** and **200m east** of drilled areas.  \n  - **12 additional untested shear zones** identified.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Fieldwork and historic core resampling to commence in coming months.  \n  - Planned drilling later in 2025 to upgrade resources to **JORC 2012 compliance**.  \n\n- **Strategic Context**:  \n  - Located **170km west** of NMR\u2019s producing Blackjack Operations (gold production commenced July 2025). Potential future feed source for Blackjack plant.  \n\n- **Caution**:  \n  - Historic results not compliant with JORC 2012; validation underway.  \n\n*Omitted: Background details, director commentary, non-material drilling data (Appendix 1), and routine disclaimers.*",
