  "summary": "- **Exploration Results at Golden Pike Project (New Brunswick, Canada):**  \n  - High-grade antimony (Sb) intersections:  \n    - Drill hole DPA-16-01: **12.5% Sb over 0.5m** (76.5m depth).  \n    - Drill hole DPA-16-03: **4.74% Sb + 2.38 g/t Au over 0.3m** (17.7m depth).  \n  - Historical boulder samples graded **up to 53% Sb**.  \n  - Antimony mineralization associated with northwest-trending fault zones.  \n\n- **Project Context:**  \n  - Recently acquired high-grade gold project with identified Sb potential.  \n  - Antimony classified as a **critical mineral** (Canada, US, Australia, EU).  \n\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Planned exploration to confirm and extend mineralization.  \n  - First-year expenditure commitment: **CAD $500,000**.  \n\n**No material trading or capital markets actions identified (e.g., capital raising, timetable, or operational cash flow data).**",
