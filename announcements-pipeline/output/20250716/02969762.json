  "summary": "### **Summary of ASX Announcement (Ark Mines Ltd \u2013 AHK)**  \n\n#### **Key Material Information**  \n- **Resource Upgrade Drilling Planned**  \n  - 2,500m drilling program to expand Measured Resource (currently 71.8Mt @ 1,732.7 ppm Monazite Equivalent).  \n  - Target: Increase resource to **350+ million tonnes**.  \n  - Drill results to feed into **Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS)** due early 2026.  \n\n- **Metallurgical Program Underway**  \n  - IHC Mining conducting tests to optimize beneficiation (gravity separation) for rare earths/heavy minerals.  \n  - Targeting improved recoveries for:  \n    - Rare Earth Oxides (TREO: 51.9% in initial tests).  \n    - Zircon, titanium oxides, garnets.  \n  - Results to inform **PFS (early 2026)**.  \n\n- **Exploration Target**  \n  - **1.3\u20131.5 billion tonnes** @ 1,286\u20131,903 ppm Monazite Equivalent.  \n  - Heavy minerals basket includes **monazite, zircon, rutile, leucoxene, ilmenite**.  \n\n- **Low-Cost Mining Advantages**  \n  - No blasting/overburden; shallow (12m depth); simple gravity processing.  \n  - Minimal environmental impact (continuous rehabilitation).  \n  - Potential for **production within 24 months**.  \n\n- **Financial Position (30 June 2025)**  \n  - **Cash: $1.6M** | Market Cap: ~$10M.  \n\n- **Near-Term Catalysts**  \n  - Mining license application (Oct 2025).  \n  - Metallurgy updates (2025).  \n  - Off-take discussions ongoing.  \n\n**No capital raising or material transaction details disclosed.**  \n\n---  \n*Note: Excluded non-material operational/background details. Focused on valuation-impacting updates.*",
