  "summary": "### Summary:  \n**Document Type:** *Appendix 3Y \u2013 Change of Director\u2019s Interest Notice*  \n\n#### Material Information:  \n- **Director:** Trevor John Croker  \n- **Transactions:** On-market disposal of Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ALL) shares:  \n  - **11 July 2025:** Sold 26,091 shares for ~$1.76M  \n  - **14 July 2025:** Sold 17,369 shares for ~$1.16M  \n  - **15 July 2025:** Sold 34,814 shares for ~$2.35M  \n- **Post-Transaction Holdings:**  \n  - **Indirect Interest:** 602,000 ALL ordinary shares (via Solium Nominees)  \n  - **Unchanged Holdings:**  \n    - LTI Performance Share Rights (PSRs): 397,195 (vesting 2025\u20132027)  \n    - Deferred STI PSRs: 41,752 (vesting 2025\u20132026)  \n- **Closed Period Compliance:** Trades did not occur during a closed period requiring clearance.  \n\n**Impact:** Significant director sell-down (~$5.27M total), but retention of majority indirect equity and unvested PSRs suggests continued alignment. No immediate capital markets implications.  \n\n**Verdict:** Monitor for further director trading activity, but no actionable trading signal.  \n\n---  \n*Omitted:* Legal boilerplate, trust/custodian details, non-material footnotes.",
