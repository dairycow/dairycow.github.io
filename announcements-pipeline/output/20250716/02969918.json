  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (Quarterly Report \u2013 30 June 2025)**  \n\n#### **Operational Highlights:**  \n- **Mt Palmer Gold Project (80% owned):**  \n  - High-grade drill results:  \n    - 18m @ **4.4g/t Au** (inc. **2m @ 31.3g/t**)  \n    - 20m @ **7.5g/t Au** (inc. **6m @ 23.8g/t**)  \n    - 3m @ **33.6g/t Au**  \n  - Shallow mineralisation suggests potential for **low-cost open-pit extraction**.  \n  - **Resource definition work on historic tailings** nearing completion (early Q3 2025).  \n  - **Expenditure milestone met** to earn 80% of JV.  \n\n- **Kirup Project (70% owned):**  \n  - New high-grade **rock chip assay (4.3g/t Au)** near prior drill intercept.  \n  - Actively seeking **JV/sale** for Mustang Prospect.  \n\n- **Wozi Niobium Project (Malawi):**  \n  - Tenement **formally granted**; exploration program planned for Q4 2025.  \n\n#### **Financial Position (Appendix 5B):**  \n- **Cash balance (30 June 2025):** **$55k** (down from $595k last quarter).  \n- **Quarterly cash burn:** **$540k** (operating activities).  \n- **Unused financing facility:** **$151k** (from $500k total loan facility).  \n- **Funding runway:** **0.38 quarters** \u2014 Company reviewing alternatives for capital raising.  \n\n#### **Key Risks/Liquidity:**  \n- **Low cash reserves** ($55k) with limited funding runway; reliant on **raising additional capital**.  \n- **ATM facility available** ($1M standby equity via Acuity Capital).  \n\n**Actionable Takeaway:** Monitor near-term funding announcements (potential capital raise/JV deals). High-grade drill results at Mt Palmer remain the primary value catalyst.  \n\n*Format: Strictly concise, trading-relevant data only. No qualitative fluff.*",
