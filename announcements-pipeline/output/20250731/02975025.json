  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Exploration Results Announcement \u2013 Key Highlights**  \n- **New high-grade gold discovery**:  \n  - **Third lens identified** ~70m southeast of Lens 2:  \n    - **11m at 5.5g/t Au** (from 196m) in hole 25GLR039.  \n    - **20m at 2.6g/t Au** (from 507m) in hole 25GLR035, including **5m at 5.4g/t Au**.  \n  - **Down-plunge extension of Lens 2** confirmed (+100m vertical depth):  \n    - **10m at 6.1g/t Au** (from 450m) in hole 25GLR033.  \n    - **5m at 13.5g/t Au** (from 361m) in hole 25GLR037.  \n\n- **Project implications**:  \n  - Potential for **high-grade underground resource expansion**, with mineralisation open at depth and along strike.  \n  - Structural model validated; historical drilling missed key zones due to incorrect orientation.  \n  - Two RC rigs operational, fully funded by recent **$13.5M capital raise**.  \n\n- **Next steps**:  \n  - Priority drilling to define **scale/continuity of Lens 3** (currently >300m vertical strike extent).  \n\n*No other material trading or capital markets information identified.*",
