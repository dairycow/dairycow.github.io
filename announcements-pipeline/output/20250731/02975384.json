  "summary": "### **Quarterly Report (Appendix 4C) Summary**  \n\n#### **Key Operational/Financial Highlights:**  \n- **Project Development (Ovoot Coking Coal Project - OCCP):**  \n  - Revised development plan to reduce initial CAPEX (rental mining equipment, outsourced coal transport).  \n  - CHPP and ERT shortlisted bids progressing; contract negotiations include export credit agency financing.  \n  - PPPA (road infrastructure) clarifications completed; awaiting formal approval from Mongolian government.  \n  - Geotechnical surveys and water wells completed for permanent infrastructure.  \n\n- **Marketing:**  \n  - Strong end-user interest in Ovoot\u2019s \"fat\" coking coal; sample feedback positive.  \n  - Coal prices (Tianjin) rose **28% post-quarter**.  \n\n- **Corporate:**  \n  - **Closing cash balance:** **$8.8M cash + $2.6M investments** (total **$11.4M**).  \n  - Quarterly cash burn: **$0.7M operating, $0.6M development**.  \n  - Leadership changes: Executive Director (Russell Taylor) and CFO (Tristan Garthe) stepping down.  \n\n- **Appendix 5B (Cash Flow):**  \n  - Net cash used in operating activities: **($0.7M)**.  \n  - Net cash from investing (bond sales): **$1.3M**.  \n  - Cash runway: **6.7 quarters** based on current outflows.  \n\n#### **Material Takeaways for Investors:**  \n1. CAPEX optimization may reduce funding needs but delays long-term infrastructure.  \n2. Progress on key contracts (CHPP, ERT, PPPA) de-risks project execution.  \n3. Healthy liquidity ($11.4M) with manageable burn rate.  \n\n*No other material information identified.*",
