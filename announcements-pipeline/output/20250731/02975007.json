  "summary": "### **ASX Announcement Summary \u2013 Critical Minerals Group (ASX: CMG)**  \n\n#### **Capital Raising**  \n- **Entitlement Offer**: Successfully raised **$2.7M** (part of a larger $7.4M target).  \n\n#### **Operational & Project Highlights**  \n**1. Downstream (Battery Energy Storage Solutions)**  \n- Progressing feasibility studies for **7 potential VFB projects** (size range: 0.5MW\u201375MW).  \n- Partnership with **McKinlay Shire Council** for Julia Creek VFB investigation.  \n- Strategic engagement with **Sumitomo Electric** (VFB technology provider).  \n\n**2. Midstream (Vanadium Electrolyte Facility)**  \n- **FEED phase completed** for Logan City facility (on time, under budget).  \n- Procured **120kg V\u2082O\u2085** for demo production; offtake discussions ongoing.  \n\n**3. Upstream (Julia Creek Mine)**  \n- **Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS)** advancing, focusing on metallurgical and footprint optimizations.  \n- Environmental studies (EIS) nearing completion; EPBC submission delayed for ecological data inclusion.  \n\n#### **Financials (Appendix 5B)**  \n- **Cash balance (30 June 2025)**: **$1.26M** (vs. $0.88M last quarter).  \n- **Quarterly cash burn**: **$1.56M** (operating + exploration).  \n- **Funding runway**: **~0.8 quarters**; additional grants ($4.8M) expected in next 12 months.  \n\n#### **Material Risks**  \n- No binding offtake agreements secured for VFB projects or electrolyte supply.  \n- Limited immediate funding (0.8 quarters) highlights near-term liquidity reliance on capital raises/grants.  \n\n**Rule Applied**: Focus on capital activity, project milestones, and financial liquidity. Omitted non-material partnerships, presentations, and routine updates.",
