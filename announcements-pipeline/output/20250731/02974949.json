  "summary": "**Material Information Summary (ASX Interim Report \u2013 30 June 2025):**\n\n### **Financial Highlights**  \n- **Cash Flow from Operations**: -$99.8M (vs. -$88.5M in June 2024) driven by higher rehabilitation costs ($106M vs. $85M).  \n- **Revenue**: $31.5M (80% YoY increase), primarily from interest income.  \n- **Net Loss After Tax**: -$35.4M (76% improvement YoY; prior period included $89.9M impairment of Jabiluka lease).  \n- **Cash Balance**: $1,239M total liquidity ($231M cash, $460M term deposits, $548M in govt.-held Trust Fund).  \n\n### **Capital Structure & Funding**  \n- **Rio Tinto Control**: Holds 98% post-2024 entitlement offer; compulsory acquisition of remaining shares pending court approval (objections from 10% minority holders).  \n- **Capital Shortfall**: $1.15B deficit; $766M raised in 2024 funds rehabilitation until Q3 2027. Further funding needed post-2027.  \n\n### **Rehabilitation Provision**  \n- **Provision**: $2.38B (down $47M from Dec 2024 due to expenditures, partly offset by cost escalation).  \n- **Key Risks**: Uncertainty around post-2027 costs, water treatment delays, regulatory changes, and tailings consolidation.  \n\n### **Jabiluka Lease (Impaired Asset)**  \n- Legal dispute ongoing over non-renewal; lease remains in force pending court resolution. Development barred without Traditional Owner consent per 2005 agreement.  \n\n### **Key Dates & Events**  \n- **Federal Court Hearing**: Rio Tinto\u2019s compulsory acquisition case timeline unresolved.  \n- **Mine Closure Plan**: Approved Feb 2025 with exclusions pending separate applications.  \n\n### **Outlook**  \n- No dividends declared. Focus remains on rehabilitation with no operational revenue beyond interest income.  \n\n**No other material information identified.**",
