  "summary": "Here is the concise extraction of material information from the ASX announcement:\n\n**Quarterly Report (Appendix 4C) Highlights:**  \n- **Exploration Updates:**  \n  - **Portland Creek Uranium Project (Canada):** Phase 2 diamond drilling program planned for August 2025, targeting shear-hosted uranium system. Phase 1 drilling identified uranium pathfinders and structural indicators.  \n  - **Reynolds/Boulding Lake Uranium Projects (Canada):** Airborne surveys completed (2,400 line km). TDEM data revealed >10km conductive anomalies, suggesting shallow (~20m) uranium targets.  \n  - **Tinco Uranium-Niobium Project (Canada):** Survey identified a major shear zone with historical samples up to 600ppm U\u2083O\u2088.  \n\n**Corporate & Financial:**  \n- **Appointment:** Rohan Bone appointed CEO (effective 1 June 2025).  \n- **Cash Balance:** AUD $619k at quarter-end (unaudited).  \n- **Exploration Spend:** AUD $1.21M (quarter); AUD $6.5M (year-to-date).  \n- **Funding Shortfall:** Only 0.39 quarters of funding remaining (per Appendix 5B). Post-quarter, received ~AUD $650k from tenement bonds/GST refunds.  \n\n**JORC Resource:**  \n- **Des Herbiers Uranium Project (Canada):** Inferred resource of 162Mt @ 123ppm U\u2083O\u2088 (43.95Mlb).  \n\n**Key Risk:**  \n- Near-term funding constraints highlighted; capital-raising discussions underway.  \n\n*Omitted: Non-material project updates (e.g., Paterson Lake Lithium, Bellah Bore) and routine administrative details.*  \n\n**Appendix 5B Cash Flow Summary:**  \n- Net operating cash outflow: AUD $361k (quarter).  \n- Net investing outflow: AUD $1.65M (mainly exploration).  \n- Quarterly cash burn: AUD ~1.57M.  \n\n**Actionable Takeaways:**  \n- Monitor Phase 2 drilling results (Portland Creek) and potential capital raise.  \n- High exploratory spend vs. low cash reserves suggests dilution risk or project prioritization ahead.  \n\n*No material information omitted; summary tailored for trading/capital markets decisions.*",
