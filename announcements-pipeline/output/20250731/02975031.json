Below is the strictly material information relevant for trading or capital markets decisions:\n\n### **Key Highlights**  \n- **Exploration Focus**: Maiden drilling planned for gold, antimony, and copper projects in NSW (Bingara & Nundle) and WA (Kanowna).  \n- **NSW Projects**:  \n  - **Bingara**:  \n    - 743km\u00b2 landholding with historical high-grade gold (up to 6.43 g/t Au) and copper (up to 24.2% Cu) results.  \n    - Sub-Audio Magnetotelluric (SAM) and LiDAR surveys completed.  \n    - **Spring Creek (gold) and Mt Everest/Mona (copper) \u2013 drill-ready targets**.  \n  - **Nundle**:  \n    - **Folly Line**: High-grade gold intercepts (5.0m at 5.86 g/t Au) undrilled for ~30 years.  \n    - **Mt Ephraim**: Intrusion-related gold-copper system (rock chip sample: 39.1 g/t Au).  \n- **Kanowna WA Project**:  \n  - Initial drilling (4,915m) returned broad anomalous gold (best: 32m at 0.44 g/t Au).  \n  - Adjacent to **Kanowna Belle mine**.  \n- **Antimony (Sb) Exposure**:  \n  - Projects in NSW\u2019s **highest antimony prospectivity zone**, comparable to Larvotto Resources' Hillgrove deposit ($300M market cap).  \n  - Antimony is a **supply-constrained critical mineral** (China-dominant producer).  \n- **Capital Structure (Post $2M Placement)**:  \n  - **Cash**: ~$2.61M (as of June 2025).  \n  - **Market Cap**: ~$8.3M (at $0.018/share).  \n  - **Top 20 shareholders hold ~69%**.  \n- **Forward Catalysts (Q3 2025 \u2013 Q2 2026)**:  \n  - **Drilling planned at Bingara (gold/copper) and Nundle (gold/antimony)**.  \n\n### **Material Risks/Omissions**  \n- **No JORC-compliant resources** \u2013 all results are historical or exploration-stage.  \n- **No near-term revenue** \u2013 pure-play exploration.  \n\n**Summary**: High-risk, high-reward exploration play with exposure to gold, copper, and antimony. Key value drivers are **upcoming drilling results** and **antimony prospectivity**.",
