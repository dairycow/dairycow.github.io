  "summary": "Here is the concise extraction of material information from the ASX announcement, tailored for capital markets decisions:\n\n### **Quarterly Activities Report (Period ending 30 June 2025)**  \n\n#### **Key Operational Highlights:**  \n- **Copper Strategy Expansion:** Focus on high-grade Cu-Au-Ag opportunities alongside porphyry copper prospects, including:  \n  - **Hall\u2019s Reward Project:** Historical production of 12,800t @ **5 g/t Au, 17% Cu, 23 g/t Ag**. Drilling planned to test extensions and a parallel lode (2km strike length).  \n  - **Wyandotte Project:** High-grade Cu-Au-Mo porphyry target; historical drill intersections up to **13.4m @ 3.6% Cu**.  \n\n- **Cockie Creek Porphyry Cu-Au-Mo:**  \n  - Maiden JORC Resource estimate **on track for Q3 2025 release**.  \n  - Highlights from 2023 drilling:  \n    - 248m @ **0.28% Cu, 0.06 g/t Au, 44 ppm Mo** (CCDD003).  \n    - 320m @ **0.21% Cu, 0.05 g/t Au, 31 ppm Mo** (CCDD007).  \n\n- **Steam Engine Gold Project:**  \n  - **Feasibility Study progressing** for toll-treatment operation (targeting early production within 2 years).  \n  - Updated Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) **expected Q3 2025**.  \n  - **SAM geophysical survey** identified untested anomalies resembling high-grade gold lodes at shallow depths.  \n\n- **Bottletree Porphyry:**  \n  - New 3D gravity model defined **two high-priority targets** for drilling.  \n  - Queensland CEI grant terminated due to monsoon delays; reapplying for future funding.  \n\n#### **Financial Position (Appendix 5B):**  \n- **Cash Balance (End Q2 2025):** **$684k** (vs. $237k previous quarter).  \n- **Quarterly Cash Burn:**  \n  - Operating activities: **-$136k**.  \n  - Exploration capex: **-$216k**.  \n- **Funding:**  \n  - Raised **$919k** (net $799k after costs) via equity issuance.  \n  - **1.9 quarters of funding** available at current burn rate.  \n\n#### **Material Developments:**  \n- **Capital Structure:** No new debt or facility drawdowns; reliance on equity raises.  \n- **Valuation Catalysts:**  \n  - Cockie Creek Resource estimate (Q3 2025).  \n  - Steam Engine Feasibility Study and MRE update.  \n  - High-grade Cu-Au and porphyry drill results pending.  \n\n### **Summary:**  \nNo capital raising or trading halt announced. Focus on **Resource definition** (Cu-Au, gold), **near-term production pathways** (Steam Engine), and **exploration upside**. Liquidity tight (~2 quarters runway); potential additional equity raises likely.  \n\n---  \n**Format:** Strictly concise, omitting non-material details (e.g., director names, boilerplate). Tailored for trading/capital markets relevance.",
