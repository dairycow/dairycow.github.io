  "summary": "- **Takeover Offer Rejection**: PointsBet rejects Betr's revised unsolicited scrip offer of 4.219 Betr shares per PointsBet share (up from 3.81), deeming it inferior to the MIXI Takeover Offer.  \n- **Takeovers Panel Involvement**: PointsBet secured interim orders restraining Betr from dispatching its bidder\u2019s statement due to disclosure concerns. Proceedings ongoing.  \n- **Board Recommendation**: PointsBet directors unanimously recommend shareholders accept the MIXI Takeover Offer (24.7% already accepted), citing Betr\u2019s higher risk profile and overstated synergies.  \n- **Key Risk Highlights**: Betr\u2019s business deemed less valuable (VIP-heavy, volatile customer base, sub-scale sports segment, high churn).  \n\n*No capital raising or trading halt details identified.*",
