  "summary": "- **Price Query Response**:  \n  - PPK confirms *no undisclosed material information* explains recent trading volatility.  \n  - **Potential catalyst for trading activity**: Discussions regarding unsolicited offer for PPK\u2019s stake in Craig International Ballistics (CIB) terminated on *29 July 2025* after failed negotiations.  \n  - Compliance with ASX Listing Rules (3.1) confirmed.  \n\n**Key Takeaway**: No active transaction or earnings surprise, but market speculation may have been linked to earlier, now-terminated CIB deal talks. No immediate trading impact expected.  \n\n*(Omitted: Legal boilerplate, query formatting, routine compliance details.)*",
