  "summary": "### Material Information Summary (Exploration Results Announcement):  \n- **Key Drill Results**:  \n  - **LVRC02**: 18m @ 1.16 g/t Au from 127m (incl. 5m @ 2.3 g/t Au).  \n  - Confirms extension of gold mineralization into fresh rock below prior aircore intercept (28m @ 1.09 g/t Au).  \n- **Geology**: Mineralization hosted in altered quartz-feldspar volcanic rocks, open in all directions, indicative of a large-scale intrusion-hosted gold system.  \n- **Next Steps**: Immediate follow-up RC and diamond drilling planned to test strike/depth extensions.  \n- **REE Potential**: Previous aircore drilling intersected 4m @ 13,406ppm TREO (assays pending for LVRC04/LVRC05).  \n- **Project Context**: Laverton Project located in prolific gold province (25Moz+ historical production), near major mines (Granny Smith, Sunrise Dam).  \n\n**No capital-raising, financials, or trading halt details identified.**",
