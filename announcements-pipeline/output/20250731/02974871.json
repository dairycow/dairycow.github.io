  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Operational Update & Key Metrics**  \n- **High-grade ore processing commenced** at Kayelekera Uranium Project, with first production expected this quarter.  \n- **Power grid connection construction starts**, targeting completion by end-CY2026; estimated to reduce costs by **US$5\u20136/lb** (vs. diesel).  \n- **US$8.5M equipment finance facility secured** (5-year term, <10% interest) for mobile/mining equipment.  \n- **Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) expansion accelerated**; Phase 1A/B capex ~**US$19.5M** (combined, vs. initial US$4M for Phase 1A).  \n- **Restart capital budget remains on track** (US$50M); unaudited cash balance of **A$75.9M** (end-June 2025), no debt drawn.  \n\n#### **Key Implication**  \nAccelerated infrastructure spending may impact near-term cash flow, but grid power and TSF optimization support long-term cost reduction (~US$5\u20136/lb savings) and operational scalability.",
