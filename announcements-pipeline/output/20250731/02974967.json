  "summary": "### Material Information Summary  \n\n**Quarterly Report (Appendix 4C & 5B)**  \n- **Capital Raising**:  \n  - Completed $1.1M placement (246M shares at $0.0045).  \n  - Post-quarter: $380K raised via exercised options (47.5M at $0.008).  \n- **Cash Position**:  \n  - Closing cash: **$0.607M** (June 2025).  \n  - Post-quarter cash injection: +$0.38M (July 2025).  \n- **Exploration Highlights**:  \n  - Maiden drilling commenced at Hurricane Project (QLD), targeting gold-antimony prospects (Hurricane, Bouncer, Holmes, Tornado).  \n  - High-grade assays: Up to **69.5 g/t Au** (rock chips) and **4.39 g/t Au** in new stockworks.  \n  - Stunalara Metals acquisition completed (100% ownership), adding gold-copper-antimony tenements (QLD, WA, TAS).  \n- **Funding Runway**:  \n  - 1.0 quarter of funding remaining (per Appendix 5B). Subsequent $380K option exercise extends runway.  \n  - Plans to raise additional capital via placement (200M shares approved at EGM).  \n\n**Key Risks/Opportunities**:  \n- **Execution Risk**: Drilling results pending; success critical for further funding.  \n- **Liquidity Pressure**: Low cash buffer ($0.607M) necessitates near-term capital raise.  \n\n*Omitted: Routine corporate updates, director details, legal boilerplate.*",
