  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:\n\n- **Exploration Results (Glenburgh Gold Project, Icon Prospect):**\n  - Multiple high-grade gold intercepts, including:\n    - 154m at 1.1g/t Au (including 5m at 22g/t Au).\n    - 134m at 1g/t Au (including 44m at 2.2g/t Au).\n    - 117m at 0.7g/t Au (including 38m at 1.1g/t Au).\n  - Bulk-scale intercepts (>200m) with grades of 0.4\u20130.5g/t Au, open at depth.\n  - Potential for a 400m-wide mineralized envelope, linking to the Tuxedo deposit.\n  - Interpretation of three higher-grade zones (0.8\u20131.5g/t Au) within the system.\n\n- **Funding:**  \n  - Ongoing drilling supported by recent $13.5M capital raising.\n\n- **Project Scale:**  \n  - Glenburgh emerging as a tier-1, district-scale gold system with >20km of untested strike.\n\n- **Operational Focus:**  \n  - Step-out and infill drilling planned to expand the resource and upgrade confidence.\n\n**Note:** No capital raising, trading halt, or financial data disclosed. Focus is on exploration progress and resource potential.",
