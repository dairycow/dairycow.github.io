  "summary": "### Material Information Summary (Exploration Results):  \n\n- **Drilling Results Highlights**:  \n  - Multiple high-grade gold intercepts at **Icon Prospect**, **Glenburgh Gold Project (WA)**:  \n    - **154m at 1.1g/t Au** (including **5m at 22g/t Au**)  \n    - **134m at 1g/t Au** (including **44m at 2.2g/t Au**)  \n    - **117m at 0.7g/t Au** (including **38m at 1.1g/t Au**)  \n  - Bulk-scale intercepts (>200m):  \n    - **272m at 0.5g/t Au**, **306m at 0.4g/t Au** (all ending in mineralization).  \n\n- **Resource Growth Potential**:  \n  - Mineralization remains **open at depth** and may link with nearby **Tuxedo deposit**, suggesting a potential **400m-wide mineralized envelope** (3x high-grade lenses at 0.8\u20131.5g/t Au).  \n  - **Bulk open-pit potential** identified due to low-strip, continuous mineralization.  \n\n- **Funding & Next Steps**:  \n  - Drilling continues with **two RC rigs**, fully funded by recent **$13.5M capital raising**.  \n  - Focus on expanding mineralization footprint and upgrading resource confidence.  \n\n**No material capital markets actions (e.g., raising, halt) identified.**  \n\n*(Note: Omitted operational/lab details, director commentary, and non-material JORC criteria.)*",
