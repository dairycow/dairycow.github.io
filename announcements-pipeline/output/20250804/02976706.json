  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (Form 604 \u2013 Change in Substantial Holding)**  \n\n- **Substantial Holder**: State Street Corporation and subsidiaries (primarily State Street Bank and Trust Company).  \n- **Total Voting Power**: **8.61%** (previously **7.26%**) in Ramelius Resources Limited (ASX: RMS).  \n- **Key Changes**:  \n  - **Net Increase**: Voting power rose ~1.35pp due to securities lending/borrowing activity.  \n  - **Significant Transactions**:  \n    - **22-Jul-2025**: Large transfers (~1.84M shares at ~A$2.04/share and ~1.30M at A$2.52/share).  \n    - **Lending Activity**: Multiple entries flagged as \"Collateral received\" or \"Lend - for stock lend.\"  \n- **Voting Rights**:  \n  - Majority held via **State Street Bank and Trust Company** (36.6M shares).  \n  - Securities lending agreements restrict voting unless default occurs.  \n- **Agreements**: Governed by **Global Master Securities Lending Agreements** (no fixed return dates; recallable on demand).  \n\n**Conclusion**: Increased institutional stake with active securities lending, but no strategic control implications. No pricing or fundamental impact inferred.  \n\n**Format**: Strictly factual, focused on liquidity/voting power changes. Excluded legal boilerplate and transactional minutiae.",
