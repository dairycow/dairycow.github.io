  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n- **Exploration Results (Morogoro Project, Kumba Deposit):**  \n  - High-grade graphite intersections from trenching:  \n    - **68m @ 18.7% TGC** (including **30m @ 21.9% TGC**) in TRUM23-004.  \n    - **84m @ 15.2% TGC** (including **6m @ 27.5% TGC**) in TRUM23-003.  \n    - **88m @ 14.0% TGC** in TRUM23-005.  \n  - Mineralization confirmed over **2km strike length**.  \n  - Shallow foliation dip (~35\u00b0 NNE) suggests true thickness ~60% of outcrop width.  \n\n- **Upcoming Work Program:**  \n  - **RC drilling program** to commence shortly, targeting depth extensions of high-grade trench results.  \n  - Results pending from **3 additional trenches at Kasanga**.  \n\n- **Market Catalyst:**  \n  - **US Commerce Department** proposes **93.5% anti-dumping duty** on Chinese graphite imports, potentially benefiting non-Chinese suppliers like IVG.  \n\n**Note:** No capital raising, financials, or material corporate changes disclosed. Focus is on exploration progress and external market dynamics.",
