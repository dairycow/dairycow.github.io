  "summary": "Here\u2019s a concise summary of the material information from the Universal Biosensors, Inc. ASX announcement (Appendix 4D half-year report) relevant for trading or capital markets decisions:\n\n### **Financial Highlights (Six Months Ended 30 June 2025)**\n- **Revenue**: A$2.76M (down 11% YoY)  \n- **Net Loss**: A$(10.45)M (up 44% YoY)  \n- **Cash Balance**: A$2.20M (down from A$8.54M at 31 Dec 2024)  \n- **Net Tangible Assets per Share**: A$0.03 (down from A$0.09 YoY)  \n\n### **Key Operational and Liquidity Risks**  \n1. **Going Concern Uncertainty**:  \n   - Cash reserves (A$2.20M) are only sufficient to fund operations into Q3 2025.  \n   - Company has \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern.  \n   - Plans to raise capital via debt or equity (see subsequent event below).  \n\n2. **Proposed Capital Raising (Subsequent Event)**:  \n   - **Structure**: Non-binding term sheet signed for a **senior secured loan facility** (up to A$8.5M) with Viburnum Funds Pty Ltd.  \n     - First tranche: A$3.5M (post-shareholder approval).  \n     - Second tranche: A$5M (subject to approval).  \n     - **Terms**: 15% interest p.a., 18-month term, 10-15% royalty on wine/water strip revenue.  \n   - **Equity Component**: Potential Security Purchase Plan (SPP) to accompany the loan.  \n   - **Conditions**: Shareholder approval required (meeting expected ~29 August 2025).  \n\n3. **Segment Performance**:  \n   - **Products**:  \n     - Coagulation (Xprecia): A$1.16M (down 19% YoY).  \n     - Wine Testing (Sentia): A$1.20M (up 12% YoY).  \n     - Veterinary (Petrackr): A$0.10M (up 81% YoY).  \n   - **Services**: A$0.31M (down 44% YoY).  \n\n4. **Costs**:  \n   - R&D expenses rose to A$2.81M (up 43% YoY) due to AQUASCOUT water testing project.  \n   - Inventory write-down: A$1.65M provision for obsolescence.  \n\n### **Key Dates**  \n- **General Meeting**: Expected ~29 August 2025 (to approve loan facility).  \n\n### **Material Risks**  \n- Liquidity shortfall if funding is delayed.  \n- Dependence on successful commercialization of AQUASCOUT (targeting H2 2025 launch).  \n\n**Summary**: Universial Biosensors faces significant liquidity challenges, with a proposed high-cost debt facility as a stopgap. Revenue declines and rising losses underscore urgent need for operational turnaround or additional capital. Shareholder approval of the Viburnum loan is critical near-term catalyst.  \n\n*Format: Strictly factual, omitting non-material details (e.g., director names, routine disclosures).*",
