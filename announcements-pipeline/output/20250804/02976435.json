  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n**Announcement Type: Exploration Results (Lithium Valley Project, Brazil)**  \n\n- **Key Findings:**  \n  - **Strong lithium anomalies** identified in soil samples from Agua Boa tenement (34% coverage), correlated with pathfinder elements (tin, thallium, caesium).  \n  - **11 drill targets** defined based on multi-element anomalies indicative of lithium-bearing pegmatites.  \n  - **Regional significance:** Tenement lies along strike from Latin Resources' Collina lithium deposit (ASX: LRS), though proximity does not guarantee similar results.  \n\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - **Drilling planned** for prioritized targets; permits and site optimization underway.  \n  - **Additional soil sampling** to cover remaining 66% of tenement, focusing on pegmatite-rich zones.  \n  - **Mapping** to identify granite sources of pegmatites.  \n\n- **Operational Context:**  \n  - Sample spacing: 50m intervals on 400m-spaced lines.  \n  - Methodology: Partial digest ICP-MS (ALS Code ME-MS41L); no drilling completed yet.  \n\n**No material financial data (e.g., costs, capital raised) or timetable disclosed.**  \n\n---  \n*Note: Excluded routine details (e.g., director names, JORC appendices) per guidelines.*",
