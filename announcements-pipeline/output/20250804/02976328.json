  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n- **Nanofiltration (NF) Breakthrough**:  \n  - 84.5% HCl acid recovery achieved, reducing acid consumption by **over 80%** (from ~37.2 kg/t to ~7.5 kg/t).  \n  - **94% of REEs** retained in concentrated retentate with **no loss** to recycled permeate.  \n  - **69% reduction** in liquid volume sent to Impurity Removal (IR) circuit, lowering capex/opex.  \n\n- **Heap Leach Efficiency**:  \n  - **79% recovery** of MagREE (Nd, Pr, Tb, Dy) from Inside Centre deposit (vs. 56% via tank leaching).  \n  - Nd/Pr recoveries stable at **~80%**; Dy/Tb at **60\u201370%**.  \n\n- **Resource & Project Highlights**:  \n  - **Inside Centre Indicated Resource**: 119Mt @ **1,632ppm TREO** (23% MagREE).  \n  - Current resource covers **<10% of tenement area**; significant exploration upside.  \n\n- **Cost Reductions**:  \n  - NF + heap leaching eliminates need for leach tanks, thickeners, and complex separation infrastructure.  \n  - Smaller IR circuit expected to **reduce capital and operating costs materially**.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Pending **Impurity Removal test results** (Q3 2025) to further optimize costs.  \n  - **Optioneering Study** by CPC Engineering due this quarter.  \n\n*Omitted: JORC details, director commentary, non-material metallurgical data.*",
