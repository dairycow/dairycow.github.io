  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Key Operational & Financial Highlights:**  \n- **Nanofiltration (NF) technology** achieves **84.5% hydrochloric acid recovery**, reducing acid consumption by over **80%**.  \n- **69% reduction in liquid volume** sent to Impurity Removal (IR) circuit, lowering capital & operating costs.  \n- **Heap leaching recoveries**: **79% MagREE** (Nd/Pr/Dy/Tb), with **Nd & Pr recoveries at ~80%** (exceeding peer benchmarks).  \n- **Inside Centre Deposit**: **Indicated Resource of 119Mt @ 1,632ppm TREO**, with **23% high-value MagREE**.  \n- **Project cost savings**: Heap leaching eliminates need for leach tanks, thickeners, and solid-liquid separation, reducing both **capex and opex**.  \n- **Exploration upside**: Current resource covers **<10% of tenements**; further growth potential.  \n\n#### **Next Steps:**  \n- Pending **Impurity Removal test results** (potential for further cost reductions).  \n- **Optioneering Study** to finalize flowsheet (expected completion Q3 2025).  \n\n#### **Valuation Impact:**  \n- **Materially improved economics** due to lower acid usage, simplified processing, and scalable potential.  \n- Confirms **Splinter Rock as a high-grade, low-cost REE project** (largest clay-hosted deposit in Australia).  \n\n**No capital raising, no material dates.**  \n**No material financial figures disclosed.**  \n\n*Summary tailored for trading/capital markets relevance\u2014focused on cost reductions, recoveries, and project scalability.*",
