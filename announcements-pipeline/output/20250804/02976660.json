  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Exploration Update Announcement \u2013 Key Points:**  \n- **New High-Priority Targets Identified:**  \n  - **Area 1 (Central J-Fold):** Deep-seated low-resistivity anomaly (>5km depth), potentially linked to mineralization.  \n  - **Area 2 (South of Bellbird):** Parallel trend to known mineralization, drill-ready.  \n  - **Area 3 (South of Rockface):** Parallel trend, validation pending further MT surveys.  \n  - **Area 4 (Reward South Extension):** Aligned with geochemical anomalies.  \n\n- **Geophysical Evidence of Larger System:**  \n  - Integrated 3D inversion modeling suggests a deeper and more extensive mineral system than previously recognized.  \n  - Two major resistivity anomalies at ~3km depth (central J-Fold and Bellbird-Rockface trend), indicative of fluid pathways/mineralization.  \n\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - **Near-term:** Infill MT surveys to refine targets; DHEM/FLEM surveys at Scarp-Crowe\u2019s Nest and Cox\u2019s Find.  \n  - **Medium-term:** Drill testing of Areas 2 and 3 (post-underground development).  \n  - **Long-term:** Expansion into Unca Creek tenement (Becana-Pioneer and Eastside prospects).  \n\n- **JORC Compliance:** No new drilling/assay data; modeling based on historical geophysical/geochemical datasets.  \n\n**Impact:** Strengthens exploration upside potential, particularly for deeper/extensional mineralization. Targets could extend mine life if validated.  \n\n*(No material capital or liquidity impacts identified.)*",
