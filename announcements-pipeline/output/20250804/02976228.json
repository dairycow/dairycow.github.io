  "summary": "Here\u2019s the material information from the ASX announcement, formatted concisely for capital markets and trading decisions:  \n\n### **Key Highlights**  \n**Drilling Results (Gold Basin Project, Arizona):**  \n- **335 new drillholes** (35,157m) completed since 2019, **not included** in the current resource estimate.  \n- **66 significant intercepts** (>15m width) with gold grades; highlights include:  \n  - **Stealth Deposit:** 82.3m @ 0.94 g/t Au, 76.2m @ 1.35 g/t Au.  \n  - **Red Cloud Deposit:** 38.1m @ 1.68 g/t Au (from surface), 28.96m @ 2.33 g/t Au.  \n- **Oxide gold mineralisation** extends from surface to **150m depth**, suitable for low-cost open-pit mining.  \n- Preliminary metallurgical tests show **excellent heap-leach recoveries**, supporting potential for low-CAPEX/OPEX development.  \n\n**Resource Potential:**  \n- Current **Inferred Resource** (JORC 2012): **8.35Mt @ 1.12 g/t Au** (299,800 oz Au, 0.5 g/t cut-off).  \n- Mineralisation remains **open along strike and at depth**, with significant expansion potential.  \n\n**Project Context:**  \n- Located in the **Walker Lane gold trend** (Arizona), host to multi-million-ounce deposits.  \n- Near **Mineral Park porphyry copper mine** (operated by Waterton Copper).  \n- Helix holds a **40% earn-in right** to the Gold Basin Project (conditional agreement signed April 2025).  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Planned **resource upgrade** based on new drilling data.  \n- Further exploration to test extensions of known deposits and undrilled historical workings.  \n\n### **Material Impact**  \n- Results support a **substantial resource upgrade** and reinforce the project\u2019s scalability in a tier-1 jurisdiction.  \n- Confirms **low-risk oxide gold** with heap-leach potential, enhancing project economics.  \n\n*No capital raising, trading halt, or financial figures requiring immediate action were announced.*",
