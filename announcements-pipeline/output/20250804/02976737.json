  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement:  \n\n- **Substantial Holder Ceasing Notice**: Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Company Limited (Soul Patts) ceased to be a substantial holder in **Metallium Ltd (MTM)** as of **31 July 2025**.  \n- **Reason for Ceasing**: Soul Patts\u2019 deemed voting power in MTM (via its >20% stake in Pengana Capital Group Limited) no longer meets the 5% substantial holding threshold.  \n- **Relevant Transactions**:  \n  - Pengana Capital Limited (a Pengana subsidiary) sold **1.1 million MTM shares** between **3\u201321 July 2025**, reducing its holding to **6.02% voting power**.  \n\n### Material Impact:  \n- **Reduced Institutional Ownership**: Pengana/Soul Patts\u2019 exit reduces concentrated holdings, potentially increasing MTM\u2019s free float.  \n- **Trading Liquidity**: Recent sales (~1.1 million shares) may imply near-term selling pressure.  \n\n*No other material information identified.*",
