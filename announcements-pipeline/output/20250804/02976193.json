  "summary": "- **Takeover Rejection**: THL rejects non-binding offer from BGH Capital and Trouchet family at $2.30/share, deeming it undervalued. Board believes intrinsic value exceeds $3.00/share.  \n- **FY25 Earnings Guidance**: Confirms underlying NPAT at lower end of analyst range ($27.0M\u2013$34.4M). Statutory NPAT likely a loss due to potential impairments (up to $36M goodwill, $21M tax write-offs).  \n- **Open to Improved Offers**: Board remains open to engagement with Consortium or other bidders for higher offers.  \n\n*No capital raising, trading halt, or liquidity-impacting events disclosed.*",
