  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (ASX: NWM - Norwest Minerals - Bulgera RC Drilling Completion)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **Phase 1 RC drilling completed**: 11 holes (2,624m) at Bulgera Gold Project, targeting down-dip extensions of known gold mineralization.  \n- **Assays pending**: Results expected in **4\u20136 weeks** (early-mid Sep 2025). Intersections include:  \n  - 1m\u201316m zones of potential mineralization (felsic volcanics/rhyolite with sulphides/quartz veining).  \n  - One 4m-wide quartz vein (near 100% veining in part).  \n  - 5% pyrite + 40% quartz vein in a Rainbow Ridge target hole.  \n- **Phase 2 drilling**: Scheduled to begin next month (Sep 2025) at Bulgera and Marymia East projects.  \n- **Updated MRE (July 2025)**: **8.39Mt @ 1.07g/t Au (288,400oz)**, a **33% increase** from prior estimate.  \n  - Includes higher-grade potential at depth (e.g., historical 550m-deep lode: 1.38Mt @ 2g/t Au).  \n\n#### **Actionable Takeaways:**  \n- **Near-term catalyst**: Assay results (due Sep 2025) could re-rate stock if high grades confirm depth potential.  \n- **Capital markets impact**: No raising announced, but Phase 2 drilling may require funding (monitor for future announcements).  \n\n**Format note**: No trading halt, capital raising, or financials disclosed. Focus on exploration progress and resource update.",
