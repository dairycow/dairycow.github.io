  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (ASX: IVR - 22 July 2025 Announcement)**  \n\n#### **Exploration Update (Athena Silver Prospect)**  \n- **New high-grade silver intersection**:  \n  - **7m @ 111g/t Ag** from 66m (hole 13BHRC001).  \n- **Previous high-grade hit confirmed**:  \n  - **5m @ 493g/t Ag** from 71m (hole 12BWRC020).  \n- **Untapped potential**:  \n  - Multiple historic holes terminated in anomalous silver mineralisation, suggesting potential for deeper/extended mineralisation.  \n- **Upcoming work**:  \n  - Gravity survey (August 2025) to refine drill targets.  \n  - Re-assaying of original pulp samples underway.  \n\n#### **Strategic Context**  \n- Athena prospect is **11km southeast** of IVR\u2019s flagship **Paris Silver Project** (57Moz Ag resource), within the same mineralised corridor.  \n- Potential to supplement Paris resource with additional silver discoveries.  \n\n#### **Key Risk/Negative**  \n- Historic drilling focused on iron; limited silver assay data. Confidence in historic results pending re-assay verification.  \n\n**Next Steps**: Drill targeting post-geophysical work.  \n\n**No capital raising, financials, or material corporate updates identified.**  \n\n*Format: Concise, trading-relevant bullets only.
