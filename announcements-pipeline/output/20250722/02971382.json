  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement: **Advance Metals Limited - Prospectus for Capital Raising**  \n\n#### **Key Material Information**  \n- **Type**: Capital Raising Announcement  \n- **Structure**: Prospectus for a nominal offer of **1,000 shares** at **$0.039 per share**, aiming to raise **$39 (before expenses)**.  \n- **Purpose**: Primarily to remove trading restrictions on previously issued shares (e.g., **Commencement Shares** issued under the Guadalupe Project earn-in agreement). Not a capital-raising exercise.  \n- **Timetable**:  \n  - **Opening Date**: 22 July 2025  \n  - **Closing Date**: 1 August 2025 (indicative)  \n  - **Expected Quotation of New Shares**: 5 August 2025.  \n\n#### **Corporate Actions & Capital Structure Impact**  \n- **Recent Issuances**:  \n  - **Commencement Shares**: 1,716,174 shares issued to Endeavour Silver Corp as part of Guadalupe Project earn-in (US$50,000 worth at 20-day VWAP).  \n  - **Pending Issuances**:  \n    - 500,000 shares to Managing Director Adam McKinnon (approved 23 June 2025).  \n    - 16.8M shares to Sailfish Royalty Corp for Gavilanes Project acquisition (pending due diligence).  \n- **Post-Offer Capital Structure**:  \n  - **Total Shares**: 266,752,008 (up from 265,034,834 currently).  \n  - **Options & Performance Rights**: 194.1M options and 25.4M performance rights outstanding (with additional issuances pending).  \n\n#### **Financial & Operational Notes**  \n- **Use of Proceeds**: No net proceeds (expenses of **$15,707** will be covered by existing cash reserves).  \n- **Key Risks**:  \n  - **Highly speculative investment**; exploration projects (e.g., Yoquivo, Myrtleford) are early-stage.  \n  - **Going concern uncertainty** highlighted in 2024 financials.  \n  - Exposure to commodity prices (silver/gold), geopolitical risks (Mexico operations), and regulatory approvals.  \n\n#### **Governance & Substantial Holders**  \n- **Directors\u2019 Holdings**:  \n  - Adam McKinnon: 575,000 shares + 5.35M performance rights.  \n  - Fadi Diab: 7.69M shares + 5M performance rights.  \n- **Substantial Shareholders**:  \n  - Sharesies Australia Nominee (6.18%), Chunyan Niu (6.15%), Finclear Services (5.28%).  \n\n#### **Additional Material Items**  \n- **ASX Trading Data (3 months prior)**:  \n  - High: $0.057 (24 April 2025) | Low: $0.040 (11 July 2025) | Last: $0.042 (21 July 2025).  \n\n**Conclusion**: Minimal capital-raising impact; focus is on regulatory compliance for prior share issuances. Operational progress (e.g., drilling results) and pending acquisitions (Gavilanes Project) are more material for valuation. Elevated risk profile due to speculative projects and financial constraints.  \n\n---  \n**Format**: Concise bullets prioritizing trading/capital markets impact; excluded boilerplate, non-material governance, and risk details.",
