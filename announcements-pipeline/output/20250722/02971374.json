  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Drilling Update**:  \n  - Hole CN001DD reached 404m depth; basement target likely between 377\u2013404m.  \n  - Hole abandoned due to ground instability; drilling contractor covering costs.  \n  - Second hole already commenced; basement coring expected by mid-August.  \n  - Early signs (slower penetration rates, higher magnetic susceptibility) suggest proximity to potential Iron Oxide Copper Gold (IOCG) system.  \n\n- **Project Context**:  \n  - Centurion Project targets a 3,500m x 5,000m magnetic/gravity anomaly resembling IOCG deposits (e.g., Olympic Dam).  \n  - Historical CRA drilling (1991) did not reach basement; Buxton\u2019s drilling aimed to confirm depth (~520\u2013700m).  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Await diamond core results from ongoing drilling for definitive assessment.  \n\n*No capital markets or trading-sensitive actions announced.*",
