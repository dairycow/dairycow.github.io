  "summary": "### Material Information Summary  \n**Announcement Type: Exploration Update**  \n\n- **Drilling Program:** \n  - Diamond drilling (DD) to recommence at Penny South Gold Project (WA), targeting 600m across:  \n    - **Target 1:** Extend RC hole SMX004 (1m @ 1.65g/t Au) to test down-dip mineralization.  \n    - **Target 3:** Two diamond holes to test down-dip/down-plunge extension of SMX009 (4m @ 2.02g/t Au).  \n  - First-ever diamond drilling at the project; results to guide future exploration and planned \"Deep Drill Program - EIS hole.\"  \n\n- **Funding:**  \n  - WA government co-funding up to **$200,000** (Exploration Incentive Scheme) for a deep drill hole (\u2265600m) at Target 1, testing extensions of high-grade Penny Gold Mine.  \n\n- **Timing:**  \n  - Drilling expected to start in **early August 2025**.  \n\n**Key Implication:** Potential catalyst for re-rating if drilling confirms mineralisation continuity near high-grade adjacent mine (Ramelius Resources' Penny Mine).  \n\n**Omitted:** Routine operational details, director commentary, and historical results.",
