  "summary": "**Appendix 4C Quarterly Cash Flow Report Summary:**  \n\n- **Cash Flow Highlights (Current Quarter):**  \n  - **Net cash from operating activities:** $170K (driven by $489K government grants, offset by $196K R&D and $119K admin costs).  \n  - **Net cash from financing activities:** $247K (drawdown from Clendon Biotech Capital facility).  \n  - **Closing cash balance:** $480K (up from $63K last quarter).  \n\n- **Key Financial Position:**  \n  - **Available funding:** $38.8M ($480K cash + $38.3M undrawn facility).  \n  - **Debt facility:** $38.5M secured from Clendon Biotech Capital (15% p.a. interest, drawn $254K to date).  \n\n- **Operational Costs:**  \n  - **R&D payments:** $196K (quarter), $266K (YTD).  \n  - **Related-party payments:** $28K (director fees and salaries).  \n\n**Material Takeaways:**  \n1. Liquidity secured via a large undrawn facility ($38.3M) for clinical trials, reducing near-term funding risk.  \n2. Positive operating cash flow this quarter ($170K) driven by grants, but ongoing R&D costs remain a cash drain.  \n\n*No material capital markets actions (e.g., raising, halt) identified.*",
