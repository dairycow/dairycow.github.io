  "summary": "- **Funding Drawdown**: $0.5 million drawn from a $1 million facility (RiverFort Funding Agreement).  \n- **Use of Funds**:  \n  - Advancing high-purity graphite product development and pilot plant trials (Alabama Graphite Refinery).  \n  - Strategic partner negotiations for Bunyu Graphite Project (Tanzania) to reduce costs.  \n  - General working capital.  \n- **Strategic Catalyst**: US anti-dumping duties (93.5%) on Chinese graphite underscore demand for non-Chinese supply chains, benefiting Volt\u2019s projects.  \n\n*No capital raising or trading halt requested; operational/funding update only.*",
