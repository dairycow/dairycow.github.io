  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (Quarterly Report \u2013 Appendix 4C)**  \n\n#### **Financial & Operational Highlights:**  \n- **Quarterly revenue:** $4.4M (unaudited, +52% QoQ, flat YoY due to seasonal respiratory demand).  \n- **Cash balance (30 June 2025):** $30.9M (sufficient for ~5 quarters at current burn rate).  \n- **Net operating cash outflow:** $5.9M (driven by inventory build for winter season).  \n- **US market delays:** Sales pipeline conversion slower than expected; one new contract signed post-quarter with a large US healthcare group (revenue expected immaterial in Y1).  \n- **Strategic partnerships:** Tecan Group (hardware) and Repado (software) engaged to develop automated high-throughput diagnostic solution.  \n- **EMEA focus:** Consolidation in progress; UK NHS adoption of enteric pathogen tests supporting infection control.  \n\n#### **Key Risks/Trading Considerations:**  \n- **US macro uncertainty** and customer workflow preferences (e.g., demand for automation) delaying revenue ramp-up.  \n- Cash runway of ~5 quarters based on current burn; no immediate capital raising signaled.  \n\n**No material capital markets activity (e.g., raises, halts) identified.**  \n\n---  \n*Note: Omitted non-material updates (e.g., conference participation, org restructuring details).*",
