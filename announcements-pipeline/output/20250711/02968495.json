  "summary": "### **Castile Resources Limited \u2013 Quarterly Activities Report (30 June 2025) \u2013 Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **Bismuth Added to Rover 1 BFS:**  \n  - Mineral Resource Estimate of **5,900 tonnes** of bismuth (critical mineral) added as a by-product.  \n  - **Price surge** due to China\u2019s export bans: From **US$6.00/lb (pre-ban) to US$55.00/lb (A$192,500/t)** in US markets (March 2025).  \n  - Strategic value: Bismuth used in **defense applications** (e.g., guided missiles for diamagnetic properties).  \n\n- **Project Economics & Progress:**  \n  - Rover 1 BFS remains **leveraged to gold (30,000oz/yr) and copper (7,000t/yr)**; higher metal prices to be used vs. 2022 PFS.  \n  - Geotechnical drilling along decline pathway **shows no adverse ground conditions**.  \n\n- **Exploration Update:**  \n  - **IOCG (Iron Ore-Copper-Gold) alteration** intersected at **Pathfinder 38** via **Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT)**\u2014first global use in IOCG exploration.  \n  - **Next 10 priority IOCG targets** selected for ANT surveys.  \n\n- **Corporate & Strategic Developments:**  \n  - **Only Australian company invited to present at Quad Conference** (Japan, India, USA, Australia) on critical minerals supply chain diversification.  \n  - **Engagement with Indian conglomerates** (Reliance, JSW, Aditya Birla, Hindalco) for **Rover 1 financing/offtake deals** (copper, bismuth, cobalt).  \n\n- **Financials (Q2 2025):**  \n  - **Cash balance: A$4.0M** (as of 30 June 2025).  \n  - Exploration spend: **A$0.48M**; no production/development costs.  \n\n#### **Material Impact:**  \n- **Bismuth\u2019s price surge and strategic defense demand** enhance Rover 1\u2019s economics.  \n- **Progress in ANT exploration** signals potential for new discoveries.  \n- **High-profile partnerships/offtake discussions** could reduce funding risk.  \n\n**No material information omitted.**",
