  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary \u2013 Castile Resources Limited (ASX:CST) \u2013 Quarterly Report (30 June 2025)**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights:**  \n- **Bismuth Resource Added to Rover 1 BFS:**  \n  - 5,900 tonnes of bismuth (critical mineral) now included in Mineral Resources.  \n  - Bismuth prices surged from **US$6.00/lb to US$55.00/lb** (A$192,500/t) due to Chinese export bans (80% global supply controlled by China).  \n  - High demand for defence applications (anti-magnetic properties for guided missiles).  \n\n- **Rover 1 Project Leverage:**  \n  - Forecast production: **30,000oz gold + 7,000t copper annually**.  \n  - BFS to use **higher metal prices** than 2022 PFS.  \n\n- **Exploration Update:**  \n  - IOCG (Iron Ore-Copper-Gold) alteration confirmed at **Pathfinder 38** via **Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT)**.  \n  - 10 new IOCG targets identified for ANT surveys.  \n\n- **Strategic Developments:**  \n  - Only Australian company invited to **Quad Conference** (Japan, India, USA) on critical minerals supply chain diversification.  \n  - Ongoing talks with Indian conglomerates (e.g., **Reliance, JSW Energy, Aditya Birla Group**) for offtake/financing deals.  \n\n- **Financials (30 June 2025):**  \n  - **Cash balance: A$4.0M**.  \n  - Quarterly exploration spend: **A$0.48M**.  \n\nOmitted: Routine operational updates, tenement details, and corporate boilerplate.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Material catalysts include bismuth price leverage, strategic partnerships, and exploration progress. Cash runway (~5 quarters) may necessitate future funding.  \n\n*\u2014End Summary\u2014*  \n\n*(Note: Pay attention to subsequent announcements for BFS timelines or capital-raising needs.)*",
