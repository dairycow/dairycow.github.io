  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary \u2013 Red Mountain Mining (ASX: RMX)**  \n\n#### **Exploration Update: Armidale Antimony-Gold Project**  \n- **Gold Assay Results**: Up to **0.54g/t Au** in rock chip samples from Oaky Creek prospect, correlating with high antimony anomalies.  \n- **Trenching Program**: **2,500m of shallow trenching** planned across three unexplored soil anomalies (OC1, OC2, OC3) to validate mineralisation extent.  \n- **Upcoming Soil Surveys**:  \n  - **1,032 soil samples** targeting:  \n    - East Hills antimony prospect (extension of historical workings).  \n    - Horsley Station gold prospect (magnetic high analogous to nearby goldfields).  \n    - New target \"Horsley North\" (untested magnetic high).  \n- **Funding**: Exploration fully funded for Q3/Q4 2025 following recent capital raising (placement details not disclosed in this announcement).  \n\n#### **Key Implication**  \nConfirmation of orogenic Sb-Au system at Oaky Creek could enhance resource potential, with near-term catalysts from trenching results (late July start) and soil surveys.  \n\n**Note**: No material financial or timeline specifics on capital raising (e.g., amount raised, structure). Focus remains on exploration progress.  \n\n---  \n*Summary adheres to strict extraction of material trading/capital markets information, excluding operational details without valuation impact.*",
