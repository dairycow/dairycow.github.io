  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Appendix 3Y Notices:  \n\n- **Christopher Hansen (Director)**  \n  - **Acquired:**  \n    - 10,000,000 Performance Rights (expiring 11 July 2030) for $114,391.  \n    - Indirectly acquired 5,555,556 Fully Paid Ordinary Shares for $50,000 and 2,777,778 Unlisted Options (exercisable at $0.024, expiring 30 Sept 2029).  \n  - **Escrow:** 11,836,515 Fully Paid Ordinary Shares remain in voluntary escrow until 02/05/2026.  \n\n- **Michael Edwards (Director)**  \n  - **Acquired:**  \n    - 1,111,111 Fully Paid Ordinary Shares for $10,000.  \n    - 555,556 Unlisted Options (exercisable at $0.024, expiring 30 Sept 2029).  \n    - 3,000,000 Performance Rights (expiring 11 July 2030) for $34,317.  \n\n- **Melanie Ross (Director)**  \n  - **Acquired:** 2,000,000 Performance Rights (expiring 11 July 2030) for $22,878.  \n\n**Common Context:**  \nAll transactions resulted from **Director Participation and Performance Rights** approved at the **General Meeting on 12 June 2025**. No closed-period trading.  \n\n**Material Implications:**  \n- Significant issuance of Performance Rights (expiring 2030) may dilute existing shareholders if exercised.  \n- Director participation signals confidence but increases potential future equity overhang.  \n- Escrow release in May 2026 for Hansen\u2019s shares warrants future monitoring.  \n\n*No other material information identified.*",
