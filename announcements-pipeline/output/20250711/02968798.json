  "summary": "**Net Tangible Asset (NTA) Update \u2013 30 June 2025**  \n\n- **Pre-tax NTA per share**: $0.4047 (down 1.97% from $0.4129 in May 2025).  \n- **Post-tax NTA per share**: $0.4047 (identical to pre-tax; no tax provisions).  \n- **Key holdings**:  \n  - **Bentley Capital (ASX:BEL)**: Carried at $0 (equity accounting), but market value is ~$0.21m based on BEL\u2019s last traded price (1 cent/share). BEL\u2019s NTA backing implies $0.133m value for Orion\u2019s stake.  \n  - **Strike Resources (ASX:SRK)**: Value dropped to $0.3m (from $0.4m) due to share price decline ($0.03 vs. $0.04).  \n  - **Property**: Unchanged at $1.85m (last independently valued June 2023).  \n- **Cash/net other assets**: $4.211m (no change).  \n\n**Material considerations**:  \n- NTA decline driven by SRK mark-to-market loss and BEL\u2019s equity accounting (zero carrying value despite ~$0.21m market value).  \n- No tax liabilities/assets noted.  \n\n*No capital or liquidity impacts identified.*",
