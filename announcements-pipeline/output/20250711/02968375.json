  "summary": "### **Chorus Limited \u2013 Q4 FY25 Connections Update Summary**  \n\n#### **Key Operational & Financial Highlights:**  \n- **Fibre Connections:**  \n  - Increased by **8,000** to **1,115,000** (offsetting **6,000** decline in copper lines).  \n  - **Uptake up 0.1%** overall (to **72.1%**), **62% in UFB2 areas** (+1pp).  \n- **Data Usage Growth:**  \n  - Avg. monthly fibre usage **671GB** (June, vs. 642GB in April).  \n  - **19% of users now consume 1TB+** (vs. 17% in Mar-25).  \n- **Network Expansion:**  \n  - **7,000 new addresses passed** (incl. 2,000 in smaller communities).  \n  - **1,200 connections activated** of 9,000 planned expansions.  \n- **Copper Retirement:**  \n  - **92,000 remaining copper lines** (only **13,000** in fibre zones; full retirement by **mid-2026**).  \n  - **68,000 copper lines** outside fibre areas, declining at **~7k/quarter**.  \n- **Speed Upgrades (Big Fibre Boost):**  \n  - Wholesale plans upgraded (e.g., **50/10Mbps \u2192 100/20Mbps**; **300/100Mbps \u2192 500/100Mbps**) at no extra cost.  \n  - **Hyperfibre adoption stable** (~5,000 connections).  \n- **Regulatory:**  \n  - Govt. **reviewing telco regulations** (TSO, TDL, fibre access rules).  \n  - Commerce Commission **draft recommendation to deregulate copper** (final by **end-2025**).  \n\n#### **Trading Implications:**  \n- **Positive:** Strong fibre growth, higher data usage, and wholesale upgrades support revenue stability.  \n- **Risk:** Regulatory uncertainty (copper deregulation, rural fibre expansion funding).  \n\n**No material capital markets activity identified.**  \n\n---  \n*Focus: Operational metrics with valuation/liquidity impact.
