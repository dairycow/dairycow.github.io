  "summary": "### **Q4 FY25 Connections Update Summary**  \n\n#### **Key Operational Highlights:**  \n- **Fibre connections** increased by **8,000** to **1,115,000**, offsetting a **6,000 decline in copper lines**.  \n- **Fibre uptake**: Overall **72.1%** of passed addresses (up **0.1%**); **62%** in UFB2 areas (from **61%**).  \n- **Data usage**: Avg. **671GB/month** (vs. 642GB in April); **19%** of users now exceed **1TB/month**. Record **30PB daily usage** (driven by gaming update).  \n- **Speed upgrades**: Completed **Big Fibre Boost** (no cost wholesale upgrades: **50/10Mbps \u2192 100/20Mbps**, **300/100Mbps \u2192 500/100Mbps**).  \n- **Home Fibre Starter (100/20Mbps)**: **+11,000 net adds** (67% from new/off-net users). **Hyperfibre demand near 5,000 connections**.  \n\n#### **Copper Retirement Progress:**  \n- **Copper lines in fibre areas**: **13,000 remaining** (target: full retirement by **mid-2026**).  \n- **Non-fibre copper lines**: **68,000** (down **26% YoY**); satellite expected to overtake copper in rural areas soon.  \n\n#### **Regulatory & Expansion:**  \n- **Commerce Commission draft recommendation**: Supports **deregulating copper services** (final decision by **end-2025**).  \n- **Proposed fibre expansion**: Aiming to cover **95% of NZ** (from **87%**), endorsed by Infrastructure Commission.  \n\n#### **Financial Impact (Implied):**  \n- **Revenue stability**: Fibre growth offsets copper decline; wholesale upgrades may drive ARPU uplift.  \n- **Regulatory risk**: Watch for final copper deregulation outcome and potential fibre expansion costs.  \n\n**No material capital markets activity (e.g., raising, guidance change) identified.**  \n\n---  \n*Prioritised for trading/capital decisions: Fibre growth metrics, copper retirement timeline, regulatory shifts.*",
