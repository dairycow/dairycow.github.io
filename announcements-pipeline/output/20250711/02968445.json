  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n- **Energy Infrastructure Agreement**:  \n  - **40MW power connection** secured for the Rincon Lithium Project via a **Medium Voltage Line (MVL) Project**.  \n  - **EDESA** (local utility) to conduct **engineering/feasibility works** (~85 days), followed by construction of a **~7km transmission line** to link with Argentina\u2019s **National Power Grid**.  \n  - **Key Benefit**: Reduces development capex by leveraging proximity (~7km) to existing **208MW Altiplano Solar Facility substation**.  \n\n- **Strategic Impact**:  \n  - Addresses critical **energy bottleneck** for lithium projects in Argentina\u2019s Salta Province.  \n  - Supports planned **12,000tpa production** and potential expansions.  \n  - Parallel infrastructure sharing with **Rio Tinto\u2019s nearby project** may further optimize costs.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - **PPA negotiations** with renewable energy providers post-feasibility completion.  \n\n*(No capital raising, financial data, or trading halt details identified.)*",
