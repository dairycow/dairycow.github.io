  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement - Spacetalk Ltd (ASX:SPA)  \n\n**Capital Structure Update (Converting Notes):**  \n- **Thorney Notes ($3m):**  \n  - To be treated as **debt** until shareholder approval for conversion to equity (under Corp Act s611).  \n  - If approval fails, full redemption in cash required (principal + interest).  \n\n- **Pure Notes ($1m):**  \n  - Shareholder approval sought under ASX Listing Rule 7.1 for equity conversion.  \n  - Approval condition cannot be waived (avoids debt classification).  \n\n**Implications:**  \n- Conditional equity raise; failure to approve Thorney Notes could strain liquidity (cash redemption obligation).  \n- Pure Notes structure avoids incremental debt if approved.  \n\n*No other material information identified.*",
