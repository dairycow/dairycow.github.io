  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement (Adriatic Metals Plc \u2013 Cleansing Notice Response):  \n\n- **Key Points**:  \n  - **Commercial Production Achieved**: Confirmed for Vare\u0161 Silver Operation (declared on 1 July 2025), but ADT asserts this was **not material information** as it was consistent with prior guidance (Q2 2025 target).  \n  - **Plant Throughput**: Reached 75% over 14 days (peaking at 90% in late June). ADT deems this **non-material**, aligning with previous ramp-up disclosures.  \n  - **Quarterly Record**: ~900m of underground development completed in Q2. ADT considers this **non-material**, citing routine operational updates.  \n\n- **Disclosure Rationale**:  \n  - ADT maintains all disclosed information was **not price-sensitive** per Listing Rule 3.1, as it matched prior forecasts (e.g., March/April 2025 updates).  \n  - **No cleansing notice update required**: ADT argues no material information was omitted from the 30 June 2025 cleansing notice.  \n\n- **Compliance**: Confirmed adherence to Listing Rules (including 3.1) and continuous disclosure policy.  \n\n**Conclusion**: No material new information impacting valuation or trading. ADT\u2019s disclosures reiterate previously guided operational milestones.",
