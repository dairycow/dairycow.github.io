  "summary": "### Material Information Summary (Exploration Update):  \n\n- **New Gold-Copper Targets Identified**:  \n  - **Ringaroo Au-Cu Target**: Undrilled open-ended Au-in-soil anomaly (>3.1ppb) with coincident magnetic/IP anomalies, adjacent to Impact Minerals' Apsley prospect (high-grade Cu rock chips: up to **7.73% Cu**).  \n  - **Gowan Green Au-Cu Target**: Untested Au-in-soil anomalies with historical workings yielding high-grade samples (**26.1g/t Au**, **24.6% Cu**, **65.5g/t Ag**).  \n  - **Razorback-Wattle Ridge Au-Cu Target**: Large untested IP chargeability anomaly; previous drilling hints at porphyry potential (increasing Cu-Au grades at depth).  \n\n- **Capital Allocation**:  \n  - Proceeds from ongoing capital raising (amount not specified) to fund fieldwork, geophysics, and drill targeting in Lachlan Fold Belt.  \n\n- **Forward Plan**:  \n  - Immediate soil sampling/IP expansion to refine drill targets; potential groundwork this quarter.  \n\nOmitted: Background details, director commentary, and non-material operational updates.",
