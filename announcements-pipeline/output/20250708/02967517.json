  "summary": "**No material information identified**  \n\n*Reason:*  \n- This is a **Corporate Governance Statement**, disclosing compliance with ASX governance recommendations.  \n- No material financial, operational, or capital structure impacts are disclosed.  \n- Routine governance disclosures (e.g., committee charters, diversity policy status) do not affect trading or valuation.  \n\n*Exception:* If governance non-compliance posed material risks (e.g., audit failures, major conflicts), it would be highlighted. Here, all non-compliant items (e.g., no formal gender diversity targets) are explained as alignment with the company's early-stage status.",
