  "summary": "- **Takeover Offer Update**: Bastion Mining now holds 86.8% of Xanadu shares.  \n- **Board Recommendation**: Xanadu's Takeover Board Committee recommends shareholders accept the A$0.08 per share offer (in absence of a superior proposal).  \n- **Risks of Non-Acceptance**:  \n  - Potential delisting from ASX/TSX, reducing liquidity.  \n  - Possible dilution if Xanadu issues new equity for Kharmagtai funding.  \n- **Offer Closure**: Deadline for acceptance is **29 July 2025** (7:00pm Sydney time).  \n- **Compulsory Acquisition**: If Bastion reaches 90%+, remaining shareholders may face lower acquisition terms.",
