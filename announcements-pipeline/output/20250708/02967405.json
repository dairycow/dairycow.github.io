  "summary": "Here\u2019s the concise extraction of material information for trading/capital markets decisions from the **ASX Takeover Bid Announcement** by Vigorous Resources for Rey Resources Limited (ASX: REY):\n\n### **Key Details**  \n1. **Bid Structure**:  \n   - **Type**: Unconditional off-market cash takeover bid  \n   - **Offer Price**: **A$0.028 per REY share** (100% cash)  \n   - **Total Capital**: Up to **A$4.97M** (if 100% accepted)  \n\n2. **Offer Premium**:  \n   - **155%** to last close (A$0.011 on 7 July 2025).  \n   - **160%** to 30-day VWAP (A$0.0108).  \n\n3. **Timetable**:  \n   - **Opening Date**: 9 July 2025  \n   - **Closing Date**: 11 August 2025 (7:00pm AEST)  \n   - **Record Date**: 8 July 2025 (7:00pm AEST)  \n   - **Payment**: Within 21 days post-closing or 1 month after acceptance.  \n\n4. **Funding**:  \n   - **Source**: A$5M unsecured loan from bidder\u2019s shareholder (Wanyan Liu) at 9% p.a.  \n   - **No financing condition**.  \n\n5. **Bidder\u2019s Existing Stake**:  \n   - **16.10% ownership** (34.07M shares) acquired from Wanyan Liu at A$0.028/share on 29 May 2025.  \n\n6. **REY Board Recommendation**:  \n   - **Unanimously recommended** (absence of superior proposal).  \n\n7. **Debt Overhang Risk**:  \n   - REY owes **A$22.2M** (12% p.a. interest) to Wanyan Liu, maturing 30 April 2026.  \n   - REY\u2019s cash balance: **A$52,000** (as of 29 April 2025).  \n\n8. **Compulsory Acquisition**:  \n   - Bidder intends to delist REY if it reaches **75%+ ownership** (ASX rules permit without shareholder vote).  \n\n9. **Tax Implications**:  \n   - **15% foreign resident CGT withholding** may apply to non-Australian shareholders.  \n\n### **Critical Risks**  \n- **Liquidity**: Low trading liquidity in REY shares.  \n- **Minority Discount**: Remaining shareholders face potential illiquidity/delisting if bid succeeds.  \n- **Debt Default**: REY\u2019s inability to repay A$22.2M loan could trigger dilutive equity raise.  \n\n**No material operational/financial updates** beyond the bid terms and REY\u2019s indebtedness.  \n\n*Summary tailored for traders & capital markets participants; excludes legal boilerplate and non-material details.*",
