[Document is an investor presentation with forward-looking statements and project overviews, but contains no immediate trading or capital markets decisions (e.g., no capital raising, material operational/financial updates, or corporate actions).]  \n\n(Note: Investor presentations typically lack immediate material disclosures unless accompanied by separate announcements. Key projects like Minbrie's drill plans or Kookaburra's PFS are exploratory/development-stage and don\u2019t yet impact liquidity or capital structure.)",
