  "summary": "- **FDA Feedback on Eftilagimod Alfa**: Positive FDA feedback on late-stage clinical development for 1L HNSCC patients with CPS <1, supporting potential accelerated approval pathways (e.g., registrational trial or single-arm study).  \n- **Unmet Medical Need**: Patients with CPS <1 (~20% of 1L HNSCC) lack effective immunotherapy options; current treatments require chemotherapy.  \n- **Strategic Focus**: Pivotal Phase III trial (TACTI-004 for non-small cell lung cancer) remains primary priority, but HNSCC development pathways under evaluation with partners.  \n\n*No capital markets-specific actions (e.g., raising, halt) identified.*",
