  "summary": "- **FDA Feedback on Efti (Eftilagimod Alfa)**: Positive and constructive FDA guidance supports further development of efti in combination with KEYTRUDA\u00ae for 1L HNSCC patients with PD-L1 CPS <1, a high-unmet-need segment.  \n- **Potential Development Paths**: FDA agreed on either a randomized registrational trial vs. standard-of-care or a smaller single-arm study (70\u201390 patients) with response rate/duration endpoints, possibly under Project FrontRunner (accelerated approval pathway).  \n- **Market Context**: ~20% of 1L HNSCC patients have CPS <1; current anti-PD-1 therapies are only approved for CPS \u22651, leaving chemotherapy as the sole option for CPS <1.  \n- **Strategic Focus**: Company prioritizes ongoing TACTI-004 Phase III trial in NSCLC but will evaluate partnerships/paths for HNSCC development.  \n\n*No capital markets actions announced (e.g., raising, timetable). Focus on clinical progress and regulatory pathway clarity.*",
