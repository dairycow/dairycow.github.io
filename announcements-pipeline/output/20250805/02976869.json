  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary: Exploration Results (High-Grade Silver & Gold Intersections)**  \n\n- **Key Assay Highlights:**  \n  - **Silver (Ag):**  \n    - **6m @ 4,747 g/t Ag** (from 46m) \u2013 ranked 5th highest-grade silver intersection globally in H1 2025.  \n    - **1m @ 17,600 g/t Ag** (from 46m, TBAC130).  \n    - **1m @ 2,240 g/t Ag** & **22.8 g/t Au** (from 53m, TBM246).  \n  - **Gold (Au):**  \n    - **4m @ 13.2 g/t Au** (from 48m, TBAC130), including **1m @ 51.2 g/t Au**.  \n    - **11m @ 3.31 g/t Au** (from 48m, TBM246), including **1m @ 22.8 g/t Au**.  \n\n- **Exploration Progress:**  \n  - **Diamond drilling** to commence soon to investigate structural controls and mineralization origin.  \n  - **Soil sampling program** completed (~430 samples); results expected September 2025.  \n\n- **Mineralization Context:**  \n  - Expanded footprint (1.5km wide) with **multiple high-grade Au-Ag horizons** (\"upper\" and \"lower\" zones).  \n  - **Broad, shallow mineralization** in oxide/transitional zones.  \n\n### **Summary:**  \nSignificant high-grade silver and gold intercepts confirm Tolmer\u2019s potential, with exploration ongoing. Results may impact resource estimates and project valuation.  \n\n**Methodology Note:** Reported intervals use >60 g/t Ag or >0.5 g/t Au cutoffs; true widths unknown.  \n\n---  \n*No capital markets actions (e.g., raising, timetable) or trading halt triggers identified.*",
