  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Announcement Type: Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) Update**  \n- **Maiden Inferred Resource**:  \n  - **Total**: 279.9Mt @ **2.45% TREO Eq** (1.16% TREO, 0.20% Nb\u2082O\u2085, 177ppm Mo).  \n  - **High-grade zone**: 136.5Mt @ **2.93% TREO Eq** (1.58% TREO, 0.19% Nb\u2082O\u2085, 295ppm Mo).  \n  - **Niobium resource**: 143.3Mt @ **0.23% Nb\u2082O\u2085** (0.1% cut-off).  \n\n- **Expansion Potential**:  \n  - Resource currently includes **~60% of Phase I drilling** (11 holes, 5,543m).  \n  - Full Phase I results (~9,500m) to be incorporated in **August 2025 update**.  \n  - Deposit remains **open** northwest and at depth; Phase II drilling starts Q4 2025.  \n\n- **Metallurgy & Infrastructure**:  \n  - **Initial Nb\u2082O\u2085 recovery**: 62.4% (tested); **Mo recovery assumed at 80%** (untested but mineralogy supports feasibility).  \n  - Metallurgical testwork expected **late August 2025**.  \n  - Located in **Namibia** with proximity to rail, power, and the port of Walvis Bay.  \n\n- **Valuation & Commodity Assumptions**:  \n  - **Price assumptions**: $60/1% TREO, $55.02/0.1% Nb\u2082O\u2085, $56.45/0.1% Mo.  \n  - **TREO Eq formula**: Combines TREO, Nb\u2082O\u2085, and Mo values with recoveries factored.  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Completion of pending assays (DD8A, DD8B, DD8C).  \n  - Expanded drilling campaign at Kameelburg.  \n  - Geophysical survey and trial drilling at adjacent **Omuronga tenement** (targeting HREEs).  \n\n#### **Key Takeaways for Traders/Investors**:  \n1. **Resource Scale**: Large maiden resource with significant high-grade component.  \n2. **Growth Potential**: Upcoming drilling likely to expand tonnage and grade.  \n3. **Catalysts**: Metallurgical results (August) and Phase I MRE update (August).  \n\n*Omitted: Non-material JORC details, historical exploration, routine operational updates.*  \n\n---  \n**Brevity Note**: If a single headline were needed: *\"Aldoro announces maiden rare earth/niobium resource (279.9Mt @ 2.45% TREO Eq), with expansion potential and metallurgy results pending.\"*",
