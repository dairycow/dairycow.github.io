  "summary": "- **Production Testing Results**: RBD10 well flowed at **264 Mscfd** (average over 14 days), a **38% increase** from initial testing.  \n- **Reservoir Characteristics**: Evidence of **pressure recharge** suggests sustained gas generation (helium/methane), implying **longer well life** and **reduced decline rates** vs. conventional reservoirs.  \n- **Development Impact**: Improved flow rates (RBD10 +38%, RBD03 +32%) support **wider well spacing**, lowering future **development costs**.  \n\n*No capital raising, timetable, or financial data disclosed.*",
