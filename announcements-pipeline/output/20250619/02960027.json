  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Exploration Results & Resource Update**  \n- **Drilling highlights (Horden Lake Project, Quebec):**  \n  - Mineralised strike extended by **500m SW**, now defined over **2,600m strike**.  \n  - High-grade intersections within wider zones:  \n    - **4.3% CuEq over 0.5m** (within 19.5m @ 0.71% CuEq).  \n    - **3.8% CuEq over 0.9m** (within 3.1m @ 1.41% CuEq).  \n    - **34.6m @ 0.58% CuEq** (HN-24-126).  \n  - Mineralisation remains **open at depth**, with deeper holes returning highest grades.  \n  - Validates **EM as a high-confidence targeting tool** for further resource expansion.  \n\n- **Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE, 29 April 2025):**  \n  - **Total Resource:** **37Mt @ 1.1% CuEq** (Indicated: 19.5Mt @ 1.17% CuEq; Inferred: 17.4Mt @ 1.02% CuEq).  \n  - **Contained Metal:** **407kt CuEq**, including **234kt Cu** and **72kt Ni**.  \n  - **Cut-off:** **0.15% CuEq** (based on pit-constrained parameters).  \n\n#### **Forward Implications**  \n- Potential for **resource growth** via further EM-defined targets (multiple undrilled conductors identified).  \n- Strengthens case for **open-pit development** given shallow, high-grade continuity.  \n\n#### **No material capital markets activity** (e.g., raising, halt, or liquidity event) identified.  \n\n*Note: Excluded routine operational/technical details, director commentary, and non-material assays.*",
