  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n**Announcement Type: Exploration Results Update (Drilling Intercepts)**  \n\n- **Key Highlights:**  \n  - Visible copper mineralisation (malachite/azurite) intercepted in **7 of 10 drill holes** at Pearl Copper Project (Arizona, USA).  \n  - **Odyssey Prospect**: 5/7 holes showed copper mineralisation; **Ford Prospect**: 2/3 holes (PRC009, PRC010).  \n  - **Maiden drilling program**: First-ever testing of Odyssey/Ford targets since 1942; **1,186m total drilled**.  \n  - **Assays expected by end-June 2025** (multi-element analysis underway at SGS Labs).  \n  - Follow-up exploration (geophysics, drilling) planned.  \n\n**Prioritized Data:**  \n- Visual intercepts (no assays yet) suggest potential for polymetallic mineralisation, supporting earlier high-grade rock chip results (e.g., 15.2% Cu, 24.8% Zn).  \n- Next catalyst: Assay results due within weeks.  \n\n**Omitted:** Operational details, JORC table, forward-looking statements.  \n\n---  \n**Format:** Strictly tailored to capital markets relevance (focus on valuation triggers and timelines).",
