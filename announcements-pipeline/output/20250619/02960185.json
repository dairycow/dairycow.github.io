  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n\n- **Announcement Type**: Shareholder Meeting Notice (Director Removal Resolutions)  \n- **Key Details**:  \n  - **Meeting Date**: 29 July 2025 (2:00 pm WST)  \n  - **Resolutions**: Vote on removal of two directors (Leslie Ingraham and Ian Stuart).  \n  - **Board Recommendation**: *Against* both resolutions.  \n  - **Requisitioning Shareholder**: Yu Yonglu (11.8% holder, acquired shares in Feb 2025 via discounted placement).  \n  - **Board\u2019s Concerns**:  \n    - No clear alternative plan from Yu Yonglu for Bryah\u2019s strategy or funding.  \n    - Accusations of opportunistic control attempt without formal takeover offer or premium to shareholders.  \n    - Links Yu Yonglu to GBA Capital (which facilitated Bryah\u2019s Feb 2025 capital raise).  \n\n- **Impact**: Potential board overhaul if resolutions pass, risking governance continuity. No immediate capital or operational changes disclosed.  \n\n**Omitted**: Background on directors\u2019 qualifications, project details, and non-material legal boilerplate.  \n\n*Note*: No trading or capital markets action required unless shareholder vote outcome alters control.",
