  "summary": "**Summary of ASX Announcement:**  \n\n- **Type:** Notice of General Meeting (Shareholder Requisitioned)  \n- **Key Details:**  \n  - **Meeting Purpose:** Vote on removal of two directors (Leslie Ingraham and Ian Stuart) at the request of shareholder Yu Yonglu (11.8% holder).  \n  - **Board Recommendation:** Unanimously **AGAINST** all resolutions.  \n  - **Board\u2019s Key Arguments:**  \n    1. Current strategy focuses on manganese/copper/gold exploration (JORC resources in place) with funded partnerships (OM Holdings, Australian Vanadium).  \n    2. Concerns about Yu Yonglu\u2019s opportunistic motives (recent investor, no clear plan, potential ties to GBA Capital).  \n    3. Warns of risks to shareholder value if control shifts without premium via takeover.  \n  - **Voting Deadline:** Proxies due by **2:00 pm WST, 27 July 2025**.  \n\n- **Material Impact:** Potential board overhaul if resolutions pass, risking strategy continuity. No immediate financial/capital structure changes.  \n\n**Omitted:** Non-material operational updates, director bios, legal disclaimers.  \n\n*Rule applied: Concise extraction of governance/control risks only.*",
