Potential board overhaul without clear strategy.  \n2. Existing projects (manganese JV, copper/nickel resources) backed by partners (OM Holdings, AVL).  \n3. Opportunistic move by Yu Yonglu (recent shareholder, linked to GBA Capital).  \n\n**Proxy Deadline**: 27 July 2025, 2:00 pm WST.  \n\n*Note: No capital raising, financials, or trading halt requested. Operational updates are not exceptional.*",
