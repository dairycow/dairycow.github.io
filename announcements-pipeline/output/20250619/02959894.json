  "summary": "**Material Information Extracted:**  \n\n### **Exploration Results (Gr\u00f8nnedal REE Project)**  \n- **Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE):** 89Mt @ 6,363ppm TREO (2,000ppm cut-off), with only ~6% of the carbonatite body drilled.  \n- **Key Minerals:** Synchysite (dominant, up to 54.4% liberation), bastnasite, monazite \u2013 favorable for Nd-Pr magnet feedstocks.  \n- **Polymetallic Credits:** Niobium (up to 4,670ppm), Yttrium (up to 777ppm), and HREEs (e.g., Dy, Tb) enhance economics.  \n- **Liberation/Grain Size:** Coarse grains (P80: 19\u2013205\u00b5m for synchysite/bastnasite) support low-cost conventional flotation.  \n- **Strategic Advantages:**  \n  - Greenland jurisdiction (deep-water port, no uranium constraints).  \n  - Comparable liberation to major REE deposits (Mountain Pass, Mount Weld).  \n- **Next Steps:** Pre-feasibility metallurgical studies (flotation, magnetic separation trials) to fast-track production readiness.  \n\n**No capital raising, trading halt, or financial figures disclosed.**  \n**Focus:** Resource scale, favorable mineralogy, and processing advantages position Gr\u00f8nnedal as a strategic Western REE supply asset.",
