  "summary": "- **Drilling Schedule & Approvals**:  \n  - Maiden drilling campaign at El Campo (REE prospect) scheduled to commence in September 2025.  \n  - BLM (U.S. Bureau of Land Management) granted final drilling approval (as per 5 June 2025 announcement), dismissing MP Materials' earlier challenge.  \n\n- **Title Dispute Resolution**:  \n  - MP Materials' contested claims over El Campo were rejected by BLM in June 2024; no appeal filed. Legal validity of Locksley\u2019s claims confirmed.  \n\n- **Operational Progress**:  \n  - Geological mapping and 3D modeling ongoing for drill targeting.  \n  - Drilling contractor selection in progress via tender process.  \n  - Submission for additional drilling at Desert Antimony Mine (adjacent prospect) to BLM expected July 2025.  \n\n**Key Implication**:  \nConfirmation of undisputed drilling rights removes a material overhang; project timeline remains on track. No financial or capital structure impacts noted.  \n\n*Note*: Announcement primarily operational; no trading or capital markets action required.",
