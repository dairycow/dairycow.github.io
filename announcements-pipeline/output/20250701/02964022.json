  "summary": "- **FY26 Reinsurance Program Update**:  \n  - **Structure**: Main catastrophe cover ($500M\u2013$6.3B), structured multi-year solution (replaces Group cover), NZ buydown cover (NZ$200M\u2013$350M).  \n  - **Key Changes**:  \n    - **Lower Cost**: Total program cost expected to be below FY25 due to rate reductions.  \n    - **Retention**: Maximum event retention unchanged at $350M for 1st/2nd events; 3rd/4th event dropdowns remain ($250M/$150M in Australia).  \n    - **New Features**: Added 2nd reinstatement for $500M\u2013$1B layer; profit-sharing mechanism in structured cover (reinsurer losses capped at $600M over 3 years).  \n\n- **Impact**:  \n  - **Earnings**: No material change to risk retention or capital targets.  \n  - **Pricing**: Reinsurance cost stability may support underlying insurance margin (10\u201312% target).  \n  - **Capital Management**: Excess capital return update to be provided with full-year results (August).  \n\n- **Market Context**: Reinsurance capacity increased for main catastrophe covers; pricing improved.  \n\n**Note**: Focus on cost reduction, margin stability, and capital return potential. Operational details (e.g., dropdowns) reflect risk management adjustments.  \n\n*Summary excludes non-material commentary on strategic reviews, brokers, or NZ-specific dropdowns.*",
