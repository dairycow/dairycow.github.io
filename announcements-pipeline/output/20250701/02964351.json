  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary (Nico Young Project Acquisition - Legacy Minerals - ASX:LGM)**  \n\n- **Project Acquisition**:  \n  - Secured **Nico Young nickel-cobalt deposit** (previously held by Jervois Global Ltd, now in liquidation) via exploration licence application **ELA6901**.  \n  - **Zero-cost acquisition** \u2013 no liabilities, encumbrances, or royalties.  \n\n- **Mineral Resource Estimate**:  \n  - **Inferred Resource (JORC 2012)** at 0.6% NiEq cut-off:  \n    - **167.8Mt @ 0.59% Ni, 0.06% Co**  \n    - **Contained metal**: 996.7kt Ni, 96.6kt Co.  \n  - **Higher-grade zone** at 1.0% NiEq cut-off:  \n    - **42.5Mt @ 0.80% Ni, 0.09% Co**.  \n\n- **Strategic Positioning**:  \n  - **Largest nickel deposit in NSW**; one of Australia\u2019s largest undeveloped Ni-Co resources.  \n  - Counter-cyclical acquisition amid depressed Ni/Co prices (oversupply from Indonesia/Philippines).  \n  - Optionality from potential **scandium/PGE enrichment** (untested historically).  \n\n- **Infrastructure & Previous Work**:  \n  - Proximity to rail, road, gas pipeline, and coastal ports (Sydney/Wollongong).  \n  - **$25M+ spent** by Jervois on drilling, metallurgical studies, and PFS work (reduces Legacy\u2019s upfront costs).  \n\n- **Next Steps**:  \n  - Seek **joint venture/strategic partner** to advance project.  \n  - Minimal holding costs; focus on core gold/copper projects (Drake, Thomson, Black Range).  \n\n- **Key Risks**:  \n  - Low Ni/Co prices; competition from Indonesian supply.  \n  - Resource classification remains **Inferred** (requires further drilling for upgrade).  \n\n**No material capital raising, trading halt, or quarterly financial data identified.**  \n\n---  \n**Summary tailored for trading/capital markets decisions. Excluded non-material operational details.**",
