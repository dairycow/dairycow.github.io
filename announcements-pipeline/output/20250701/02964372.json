  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement  \n**Type:** Response to ASX Compliance Inquiry (Listing Rule 15.7)  \n\n#### Key Points:  \n- **Potential Breach of Listing Rules**: ASX questions whether GVF disclosed capital raising details (placement size: **$10M\u2013$15M**, price: **$1.34/share**) to media (Australian Financial Review) before official announcement.  \n- **GVF\u2019s Response**:  \n  - Denies providing specifics to media but confirms a representative mentioned *no broker involvement* (cost-saving rationale) during a journalist call on **17 June 2025**.  \n  - States no knowledge of how media obtained placement details.  \n- **NTA Context**: Confirms prior disclosure of **NTA/share at $1.3389** (31 May 2025) but no final placement quantum certainty at time of media report.  \n- **Compliance Measures**:  \n  - Existing **Continuous Disclosure Policy** enforced; price-sensitive info restricted to internal parties.  \n  - No additional steps planned beyond current protocols (deemed adequate).  \n\n#### Material Impact:  \n- **Regulatory Risk**: Scrutiny over potential breach of Listing Rules 3.1/15.7, though GVF asserts compliance. No immediate financial impact disclosed.  \n\n**Trading Implications**: Monitor for ASX disciplinary action or reputational effects. No new capital or operational data affecting valuation.  \n\n*Omitted*: Governance policy details, director names, legal boilerplate.  \n\n---  \n**Brevity Note**: If no further ASX action occurs, this event is unlikely to materially alter trading decisions.",
