  "summary": "### **Material Information Summary**  \n\n**Exploration Results Announcement**  \n- **Project:** Montezuma Antimony & Silver Project (Tasmania)  \n- **Drilling Program:** 50\u201360 holes (8,000\u201310,000m) in progress; assays received for first 9 holes.  \n- **Key Intersections:**  \n  - **MZS05:** 2.8m @ 3.88% SbEq (1,378 g/t AgEq), incl. 1.6m @ 5.14% SbEq (1,825 g/t AgEq).  \n  - **MZS11:** 3.5m @ 4.27% SbEq (1,519 g/t AgEq), incl. 1.5m @ **9.16% SbEq (3,254 g/t AgEq)**.  \n  - **MZS13:** 9.2m @ 2.27% SbEq (806 g/t AgEq), incl. 6.2m @ 3.19% SbEq (1,133 g/t AgEq).  \n- **Second Lode Discovery:** New parallel antimony-silver lode identified alongside stockwork veins.  \n- **Gold Assays Pending:** Results for first 9 holes expected shortly.  \n- **Next Steps:** 10 additional holes completed; assays pending. Drilling continues with mineralization open along strike/depth.  \n\n**Critical Context:**  \n- **Antimony Status:** Classified as critical mineral (Australian/Tasmanian governments); China banned exports to US (Dec 2024), tightening supply.  \n- **Price Sensitivity:** Sb prices tripled in Western markets YoY (+70% in China).  \n\n**Previous Results (High-Grade Confirmation):**  \n- Historic intercepts up to **31.9% Sb, 5,460 g/t Ag** (referenced from prior announcements).  \n\n**Operational Notes:**  \n- Assays conducted at ALS (Burnie, Brisbane, Townsville) due to high sample volume.  \n- Metallurgical recoveries: 74.5% Sb, 77.9% Ag (preliminary flotation tests).  \n\n**Valuation Impact:** High-grade intercepts and expanding mineralization reinforce resource potential, particularly given antimony\u2019s critical status and supply constraints.  \n\n*No material changes to technical assumptions or tenement status.*  \n\n---  \n**Brevity Rationale:** Focused on (1) drill results demonstrating grade/scale, (2) discovery of new lode, (3) antimony\u2019s criticality/supply dynamics, and (4) operational progress. Omitted repetitive assays, generic JORC details, and non-material project history.",
