  "summary": "### Material Information Summary:  \n**Announcement Type:** Exploration Results (Drilling Update)  \n\n- **Project:** Jims Gold Mine (Central Tanami Project, 50/50 JV with Northern Star)  \n- **Key Results:**  \n  - **Jims Gold Mine:**  \n    - Multiple high-grade intercepts reported, including:  \n      - 6.39m @ 3.98 g/t Au (from 371.90m)  \n      - 12.17m @ 6.94 g/t Au (from 386.24m)  \n      - 8.85m @ 3.64 g/t Au (from 426.45m)  \n      - 13.00m @ 5.14 g/t Au (from 81.00m)  \n    - Assays pending for 15 diamond core tails (to be released later).  \n  - **Galifrey Gold Prospect:**  \n    - Narrow, low-to-moderate grade intercepts from 3-hole program (e.g., 1.34m @ 1.97 g/t Au).  \n\n**No capital/financial data or forward-looking catalyst dates provided.**  \n\n**Conclusion:** Results confirm extensions of mineralisation at Jims, but no immediate trading or capital structure impacts.  \n\n**Note:** Omitted routine operational/JORC details. Focused on material assay results.",
