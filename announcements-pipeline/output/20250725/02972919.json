  "summary": "### **TechGen Metals Limited \u2013 Quarterly Report (30 June 2025) \u2013 Material Information Summary**  \n\n#### **Key Highlights (Operational/Exploration):**  \n- **Blue Devil Project (WA):**  \n  - Heritage Protection Agreement (HPA) secured with Jaru Traditional Owners, enabling exploration licence grant and drilling preparation.  \n  - Airborne EM identified 3 late-time conductors near a magnetic intrusion, suggesting potential for copper-gold mineralisation.  \n  - Heritage survey scheduled for late July 2025 to enable drill testing of priority targets.  \n\n- **Copper Springs Project (WA):**  \n  - Airborne EM survey identified 19 high-priority conductors (mid/late-time), some coinciding with magnetic highs.  \n  - Targets resemble magmatic or VMS-style mineralisation (similar to Savannah Ni-Cu Mine).  \n\n- **Mt Boggola Project (WA):**  \n  - Dipole-Dipole IP survey commenced over Northern Star Soil Anomaly (peak values: 48.8g/t Au, 27.8% Cu, 3.92% Sb).  \n\n- **El Donna Project (WA):**  \n  - 85-hole aircore drilling (6,355m) completed, targeting gold-arsenic anomalies near Penny\u2019s Find Gold Mine. Assays pending.  \n\n- **Agnew Project (WA):**  \n  - 572-sample soil geochemistry program completed; assays pending.  \n\n- **John Bull JV (NSW):**  \n  - Novo Resources extended gold soil anomaly (peak 1.59g/t Au) and plans RC drilling in Q3/Q4 2025.  \n\n- **Corporate:**  \n  - **Cash balance:** $0.8M (as of 30 June 2025).  \n  - **Funding runway:** ~1.4 quarters based on cash outflow trends.  \n\n#### **Forward Work Plans (Q4 2025):**  \n- Results awaited from:  \n  - Agnew soil sampling, Blue Devil satellite studies, Mt Boggola IP survey, and El Donna aircore drilling.  \n\n**No material capital raising, M&A, or liquidity events disclosed.**  \n\n---  \n*Note: Non-material operational, corporate, or JV details omitted for brevity.*",
