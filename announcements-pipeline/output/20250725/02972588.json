  "summary": "### Summary of ASX Announcement: June 2025 Quarterly Report (ASX: SNX)  \n\n#### **Material Information for Capital Markets/Trading Decisions:**  \n1. **New Pass Gold Project (Nevada, USA)**  \n   - SNX acquired **100% ownership** of the New Pass Gold Mine (previously under lease), extinguishing royalties and securing all mining infrastructure/stockpiles.  \n   - **Tailings sampling results**:  \n     - Average grade of **1.55g/t Au** across 113 samples from four historic tailings dams.  \n     - **Peak grades**: 4.09g/t Au (Tailings Dam 3) and 4.03g/t Au (Tailings Dam 1).  \n     - Tailings Dam 1 (average **1.87g/t Au**) has potential depth of **4m**, indicating significant mineralized material.  \n   - **Next steps**: Investigating advanced processing options for tailings; permitting underway for bulk sampling of high-grade veins (targeting Superior Vein, where prior drilling hit **26.7g/t Au**).  \n\n2. **Financial Position (Appendix 5B)**  \n   - **Cash balance**: **US$726K** (down from US$1.14M last quarter).  \n   - **Cash burn**: Net operating cash outflow of **US$208K**; exploration spend of **US$237K**.  \n   - **Funding runway**: ~1.6 quarters based on current outflows, with plans to manage expenditures or raise capital if needed.  \n\n3. **Corporate Updates**  \n   - Change of Company Secretary (Sophia Qing Huang appointed).  \n\n#### **Omitted**: Routine operational updates, director commentary, and non-material project details.  \n\n**Conclusion**: Focus on high-grade tailings potential and tightening liquidity. Permitting progress for bulk sampling could catalyze near-term re-rating.  \n\n*Brevity note: Exceeds ideal bullet count due to dual material disclosures (project + cash). Adjust if needed.*",
