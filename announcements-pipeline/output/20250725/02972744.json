  "summary": "### **Summary of ASX Announcement: Openn Negotiation Ltd \u2013 Quarterly Report (Appendix 4C) & Activities Update**  \n\n#### **Key Material Information**  \n1. **Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) Status**  \n   - DOCA effectuated on **17 January 2025**, exiting administration. Control returned to new directors.  \n\n2. **Capital Structure & Funding**  \n   - **Recapitalisation approved (19 August 2024)**:  \n     - Issued **101.626 million shares** raising **$211,000**.  \n     - Independent Expert Report (IER) deemed terms **fair and reasonable**.  \n   - **Loan from ST Holding 2 (major shareholder)**:  \n     - **$74,959.74** (interest-free, maturity 31 Dec 2025).  \n\n3. **Financial Position (June 2025 Quarter)**  \n   - **Cash balance**: **$168k** (up from $164k previous quarter).  \n   - **Cash burn**: **Net operating outflow of $71k** (quarter), **$265k** (12-month).  \n   - **Funding runway**: **2.37 quarters** (based on current cash and burn rate).  \n\n4. **Operational Activity**  \n   - **No substantive business activities** during the quarter (per ASX Listing Rule 4.7C.1).  \n\n5. **Related-Party Payments**  \n   - **$20k** paid to directors (salaries, fees, superannuation).  \n\n#### **Conclusion**  \n- Liquidity remains tight with minimal runway; survival dependent on further shareholder funding. Recapitalisation and DOCA execution provide short-term solvency but no operational progress.  \n\n**Omitted**: Legal/administrative detail, forward-looking statements, non-material director disclosures.",
