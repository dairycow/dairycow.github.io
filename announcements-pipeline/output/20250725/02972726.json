  "summary": "- **Listing Rule Compliance Notice**: Rewardle Holdings Limited (RXH) faces delisting due to prolonged suspension (since 2 October 2023) for failing to lodge financial reports.  \n- **Key Deadlines**:  \n  - Delisting scheduled for **31 August 2025** if FY24 Preliminary Final Report (due 30 August 2024) is not lodged.  \n  - Delisting scheduled for **1 October 2025** if audited FY24 accounts (due 30 September 2024) are not lodged.  \n  - Final delisting on **3 October 2025** (2-year suspension anniversary) if unresolved.  \n- **Reason for Non-Compliance**: RXH\u2019s auditor requires audited accounts of CloudHolter Pty Ltd (49.8%-owned, RXH\u2019s largest client/debtor, contributing 95% of FY23 revenue) for equity accounting. CloudHolter\u2019s audit is outside RXH\u2019s control.  \n- **ASX Requirement**: RXH must lodge outstanding financials and demonstrate compliance with Listing Rules (especially 12.5) by **18 September 2025** to avoid delisting.  \n\n**Material Impact**: High risk of delisting due to unresolved audit dependency on a related-party entity (CloudHolter). Liquidity and valuation concerns persist.",
