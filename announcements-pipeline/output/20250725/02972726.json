  "summary": "- **Delisting Risk**: Rewardle Holdings (RXH) faces automatic removal from ASX on three potential dates due to prolonged suspension (since 2 Oct 2023) and failure to lodge financial reports:  \n  - **30 Aug 2025** (if FY24 Preliminary Final Report not lodged)  \n  - **30 Sep 2025** (if audited FY24 accounts not lodged)  \n  - **2 Oct 2025** (2-year suspension anniversary).  \n\n- **Key Compliance Issue**: RXH\u2019s audits delayed due to reliance on CloudHolter (49.8% owned, largest debtor/client contributing >95% of FY23 revenue), whose accounts are controlled by a third party (founder is brother of RXH\u2019s Chairman).  \n\n- **Remediation Deadline**: RXH must lodge outstanding financials and submit compliance plans (Listing Rules 12.5, 3.1, 12.1, 12.2, 4.8) by **18 Sep 2025** to avoid delisting.  \n\n- **Material Exposure**: RXH has invested **>$21M** in CloudHolter (debt-to-equity since Jun 2022).  \n\n*Note: No trading impact as shares remain suspended.*",
