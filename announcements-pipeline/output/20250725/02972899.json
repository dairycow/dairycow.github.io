  "summary": "### **Summary of ASX Announcement - Notice of Ceasing to be a Substantial Holder**  \n\n- **Holder**: UBS Group AG and related entities ceased to be a substantial holder in Johns Lyng Group Ltd on **23 July 2025**.  \n- **Key Transaction Activity (Appendix A)**:  \n  - **Net Selling**:  \n    - **22-Jul-25**: Returned 1,181,700 + 92,253 = **1,273,953 shares** (stock returned by UBS AG London Branch).  \n    - **22-Jul-25**: Sold **783,928 shares** (stock returned by UBS Securities LLC).  \n    - **23-Jul-25**: Sold **1,309,800 shares** (stock returned by UBS Securities LLC).  \n  - **Net Buying**:  \n    - Multiple small purchases (e.g., 2.34M shares on 23-Jul-25, 1.06M on 22-Jul-25), likely market-making or client facilitation.  \n\n- **Material Impact**:  \n  - **Substantial Liquidity Event**: Over **3.3M shares** (net) effectively exited UBS\u2019s holdings, indicating reduced institutional ownership.  \n  - **Market Overhang Risk**: Potential selling pressure if remaining shares held by clients are unwound.  \n\n**Conclusion**: UBS no longer holds a substantial stake, with significant share returns suggesting reduced exposure or client mandate closure. Monitor for further sell-side activity.  \n\n*(Omitted: Routine trading updates, legal boilerplate.)*",
